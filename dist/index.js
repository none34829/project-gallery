Consequently, part of the brain is unable to obtain the blood (and oxygen) it needs, so brain cells die. This makes it important to be able to assess the probability of a stroke given features that are specific to patients so that they could take preventative measures in the future. Thus, the unpredictability and deadliness of strokes pose the following questions: Can we predict the occurrence of a stroke from few facts about the patient easily accessible by the doctor? What are the most important features for stroke prediction? In this project, we investigate the feasibility of using a supervised machine learning model to predict stroke occurrence. In practice, however, we faced challenges such as low prevalence and the imbalance in the available dataset, with many more negative than positive cases. In this research paper, we do a parametric study of class weighting as a way to tackle imbalance during training. We then infer the most important features that should be taken into consideration for stroke prediction. Assessing feature importance allows for patients to focus on two or three areas that may be contributing to their high probability for getting a stroke. The most significant result was that the most important feature that should be considered when determining the probability of an individual getting a stroke is age. However, there is no distinct second most important feature. Additionally, a non monotonic improvement with a class weight of 22.5 for positive cases in this dataset produces the most optimal results. \n",research_paper:"assets/pdfs/070cedde410910544ceefd49565631e69a685b9a.pdf",project_yr:"2022",project_quarter:"Summer",graphic_link:"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/04/07/2021.04.02.21253083/F1.large.jpg",headline:"In this research paper, we do a parametric study of class weighting as a way to tackle imbalance during training.

For many years, these predictive models included race as a variable. This decision recently came under fire, and the Maternal Fetal Medicine Unit (MFMU) published a calculator that did not include race as a variable, but still predicted VBAC success with high accuracy.

Further, the predicted VBAC rates increased as a function of societal marginalization: Black patients were 47.6% likely to have a successful VBAC, Asian patients had a 48.6% probability, and White patients had a 49.4% probability.

Generally, if the accuracy of a machine-learning model is higher than 50% then it performs relatively well. With more training and a greater number of images, the program could potentially increase in accuracy.

Due to this fact, scientists have created numerous methods of modelling the climate, with mathematical models being used most widely. However, due to some limitations that these models hold, researchers have turned to utilize machine learning models to predict the future climate. This is because AI has a reputation for being able to handle complex data and recognize patterns that humans previously could not have. This study aims to create a baseline machine learning model that utilizes an Autoregressive Recurrent Neural network with a Long Short term memory implementation for the purpose of predicting climate. This type of model architecture has been utilized for other applications that relate to time series data, yet it has yet to be attempted to be used in the context of climate predictions. The data that was utilized was retrieved from the ensemble mean version of the ERA5 dataset. The model created from this study was able to predict the general trends of Earth(i.e, the poles are cold, and the equator region is warm) for both when predicting the climate and when it was predicting weather. When predicting the climate, the model was able to have fair accuracy for a long period of time, with the ability to predict seasonal patterns. This feat is one that other researchers were not able to do with the complex reanalysis data that this study has utilized. This work demonstrated that this type of model can be utilized in a climate forecasting approach as a viable alternative to mathematical models and can be utilized to supplement current work that is mostly successful in short term predictions.

However, for radiation therapy to be effective, the segmented magnetic resonance image (MRI) in which the oncologists base where to apply the radiation must be segmented nearly 100% accurately, or else the energy beams will mistakenly damage healthy brain tissue.

With the onset of emerging data, data analysts have relied on ML models to reveal hidden trends. In past papers, machine learning has been brought up countless times as an innovative method to rapidly sort through data in big groups. However, developing an artificial neural network model is a sparsely used tool in research due to its lack of human interface, risk factors, and not enough experimentation in real-life applications. In this research, we implemented multiple ANN models to identify factors in a water’s chemical levels to identify which has the largest weight or bias in determining whether the water is potable or not. Subsequently, we created a model that uses these parameters to analyze and predict whether a water source will be safe to drink. Water is an essential resource for all beings on Earth, and as the climate changes, the water levels rise, and along comes pollutants to once safe drinking water. By comparing the accuracy between both classifier and regressor ML models, each model was hyper-parameterized to develop a better accuracy, as well as identify the weight each parameter carries towards the potability of the source. The results demonstrate a promising conclusion that the number of solids affects the potability versus other chemical levels.

The problem has not been answered before with this data set, and the scientific community does not have a large amount of research that has pertained to this specific APOGEE data release. By addressing this previously unaddressed problem, we can advance the scientific community with a new contribution that allows scientists of the future to gain additional data in conditions where such data may not be so readily available. We have approached the question by using various machine learning algorithms to discover correlations between the data points we were given, creating a predictive model to produce a numerical result. Gravity and temperature do not present a direct linear relationship to the iron content of a star. However, as their data points tend to cluster together, we can utilize the KNeighborsRegressor to find correlations in the way that these points have, and produce a numerical prediction. Throughout testing we’ve found that the KNeighborsRegressor does better on all accounts in comparison to a large variety of other regression models such as the GaussianProcessRegressor. Considering the results of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error function upon the results of both of these, we can note how the LinearRegressor, mathematically, does marginally better than the KNeighborsRegressor, at a value of 1.13% of average error in comparison to 2.53%.

A solar flare is typically accompanied with a coronal mass ejection (CME), in which a highly magnetic plasma is released from the sun’s corona into the heliosphere. CMEs are capable of reaching earth and colliding with the earth’s magnetic field, causing dangerous geomagnetic storms that can start fires and cause power outages. It is imperative that flares are studied so that actions can be taken to mitigate the effect of geomagnetic storms. Our data was sourced from the RHESSI telescope which consisted of almost 100,000 entries. It was shown in Fletcher’s paper that there exists a correlation between radial distance and the energy of a flare. We began with classifying solar flares based on their radial distances and then applying machine learning models like logistic regression, KNN classification, Decision Trees and MLP Classification and closely examining the ones that gave the highest accuracy. Our different machine learning models showed that there existed a pattern in the phenomena of solar flares and our AI could be used to predict them accurately.

The background of this issue is that there is always an underlying human prejudice present in the criminal justice system when it comes to making judgments, thus it is crucial to determine whether or not this human bias is required while making these decisions and whether there is similar kind of bias with machine learning methods. There are various ways to approach and respond to this topic, but the strategy we used involved examining the key variables that might influence prejudice, such as gender or ethnicity, and comparing how well the AI system can predict whether someone is likely to recidivate with or without incorporating these protected characteristics. The research's significant findings are that, after utilizing a number of different models, logistic regression was used to determine whether or not an offender was likely to recidivate. The accuracy of the predictions for our logistic regression model was 67.74 percent without the removal of any protected characteristics that hold risk of being discriminated against unfairly, but it increased to 68.16 percent when race and gender were taken into account. The random Forest model revealed that, after accounting for the gender characteristic, the mean absolute error—the percentage of variance between each measurement and the quantity's actual value—was 34.06 percent along with an accuracy score of 65.94 percent. The main results drawn from this demonstrate that utilizing various models and measuring the precision, recall, and accuracy of each race and gender are comparable with or without protected characteristics. Although the accuracy of this still isn't the finest, it could demonstrate that bias may not be as significant a factor in decision-making as it may first appear. This, however, can also be contested because the dataset utilized to train these models could be encoding real world bias such that race and gender get encoded into other variables such as prior offenses; this would mean that even if we removed race and gender data it would still be present in our model through other variables.

This issue is significant for the following reasons. By the conclusion of the school year, students had an average of five months’ worth of math and four month’s worth of reading behind them, according to an analysis of the pandemic’s effects on K-12 student learning. For example, student testing in 2021 was about ten points behind in math and nine points behind in reading, compared with matched students in previous years. The pandemic expanded already-existing achievement and opportunity inequities, particularly harming historically underprivileged students. Children in low-income schools had seven months of unfinished arithmetic work at the end of the year, compared to six months for students in majority-Black schools. High school students are now more likely to drop out, and seniors, particularly those from low-income households, are less likely to continue their education after graduation. The crisis also had an effect on pupils’ general health and well-being, with more than 35% of parents expressing severe or great concern for their kids’ mental health. The effects of the epidemic pose a threat to the hopes and possibilities for this generation far into adulthood. Their chances of enrolling in college and subsequently securing a rewarding profession that allows them to sustain a family may be adversely affected by the knock-on effects. Furthermore, analysis indicates that the pandemic’s effects on schooling may result in today’s students earning $49,000 to $61,000 less in their lifetime unless measures are implemented to remedy unfinished learning. The overall approach that was used to answer this question involved using statistical analysis to examine the correlation between how certain factors such as being economically disadvantaged or being hispanic affected student proficiency scores on New York State regents exam tests in 2018 and 2021 in different schools. Some of the significant results that came out of this research paper involved certain demographics such as those who were economically disadvantaged and those who were white. Specifically, in relation to how their demographic correlated with their school’s percent proficiency difference in a subject exam between the years 2018 and 2021. For example, 100% of the students of the Academy for Language and Technology are economically disadvantaged and compared to 2021, the number of students who were proficient in English dropped by 49%. Furthermore, 72% of Akron High school’s students are economically disadvantaged and compared to 2021, the number of students who were proficient in English dropped by 68%. However, on the other side of the spectrum, students of white descent did not fare as badly. For instance, Adirondack Middle School has an approximate demographic makeup of 100% white students. Their student’s percent proficiency when it came to their Algebra I score did not change at all. Additionally, Yonkers Montessori Academy has a demographic makeup where 46% of its students are white. The students from this school showed a 5% increase in their proficiencies in their science scores. The research that was conducted as the basis for this paper was done in an effort to examine the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on student performance across various schools in New York. Specifically, it affected some demographics disproportionately when compared to others. Due to students being forced to learn from home, some without the necessary technology and adequate resources. Consequently, a lot of students took a significant hit to their academic progress. For instance, 100% of a student’s demographic make up is economically disadvantaged and out of these students, 49% of them were no longer proficient in ELA after the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas, students of white descent did not fare as badly.  For instance, Adirondack Middle School has an approximate demographic makeup of 100% white students.

By using a machine learning algorithm, we have been able to create a tool that can detect what type of material an item is and determine whether it is recyclable or not.

Some chatbot applications use phone sensors and other device data to make predictions about the severity of a patient’s mental illness. While this makes these predictions more accurate, they might compromise user trust. In this paper, we are trying to find which data we should collect from the user’s phone to minimize the amount of data being collected but also collecting adequate information to predict their mental health score. This is important because users are not fully trusting the mobile apps since they are afraid the apps might track all of their personal information. If we determine which data is actually necessary, we can build better user trust while maintaining the efficacy of a chatbot. The overall approach was to first collect the data that was deemed useful, such as education, sensing, survey, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data, and then found how the accuracy of the scores would decrease when each category of data collected was removed to determine the most important category to collect, as well as what combination of categories yielded the highest accuracy. The most significant result was that when we didn’t include the data from the surveys, the accuracy went down significantly.

Existing solutions such as police testing drivers suspected to be under influence is simply impractical considering the number of possible intoxicated drivers. With more and more people gaining access to a vehicle, it is crucial that more effective strategies be developed to detect and combat drunk driving.

To address this question, a dataset named drunkImagesWebp was used. Two machine learning algorithms, Logistic regression and decision tree were then trained on this dataset with facial image data of intoxicated people to accurately predict the sobriety of humans based on facial cues. After testing this model, it became clear that both Logistic regression and decision tree models can indeed accurately test a driver for signs of intoxication with well over 90% accuracy compared to human-administered tests with can only hit up to around 75% accuracy.

The main sources of NO2 are related to transportation and stationary fuel combustion sources [U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2018]. With a global shift to electric vehicles (EVs), their potential to mitigate pollution is becoming prominent. In India, where air quality concerns are paramount, understanding the tangible benefits of EV adoption is crucial. The research question explores whether increasing EVs adoption can visibly reduce NO2 levels. The approach combines use of various supervised machine learning models and simulations to understand the impact of socio-economic factors,  adoption of electric vehicles, energy generations and emission factors on the NO2 levels and to  create a model to predict the level of NO2.  The created model will be used to estimate the impact different EV adoption levels can have on NO2. To train the model, data from 49 US states along with 5 Indian states where EV sales are comparable and the NO2 data was available has been used. Among diverse algorithms tested, the Neural Network turns out to be the best which predicts NO2 levels with a R2 value of 0.82. Simulations, varying EV numbers while holding other factors steady, demonstrated a clear link between higher EV count and lower NO2 levels. The results not only validate the potential of electric vehicles as catalysts for improving air quality but also highlight their crucial role within the Indian context, especially in the state of  Delhi which we have used as our case study. The empirical evidence underscores the pivotal contribution that EVs could make to enhancing Delhi’s air quality profile.

Every day, each person’s body prevents tumors from growing, and it’s all thanks to the p53 protein suppressor. Coded by the TP53 gene, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is responsible for signaling the cell repair and/or cell apoptosis pathway when damaged DNA growth is detected. In over 50% of human cells, the code for the p53 protein is corrupted, reducing its ability to inhibit tumor growth. When tumorous cells are present, there can be an overexpression of the MDM2 protein. The MDM2 protein is a protein that suppresses the activity of p53 making it even harder for controlling the potential development of cancer.\n\nThis research project targets the interaction between the MDM2 and p53 proteins to find out the most efficient ligands, or small molecules, that can bind to MDM2 and prevent the inhibition of p53 so as to stimulate the opportunity for p53 to signal for cell repair/death. This was accomplished by pre-processing a dataset of known MDM2-p53 inhibition ligands from chEMBL using Numpy/Pandas and adding necessary features into the dataset from rdKit. The processed data was then ran through a Sklearn regression model to accurately predict the efficiency of the ligands or the negative log of their Standard Value (binding efficiency).\n\nOverall, the model was able to perform quite well after optimization; however, it would produce even more accurate results if the images consisting of each ligand’s molecular structure could be processed as well since it would allow for a greater variety of features to draw patterns between. \n\nFor further research, this project will be expanded into predicting new ligands through given features based on the efficiency of known ligands with specific features.

While my research is purely theoretical at this stage, I believe that my proposed machine learning architecture has the potential to pave the way for future studies and practical implementations in the field of supercell thunderstorm prediction, providing significant improvements in forecast accuracy and lead time. \n",research_paper:"assets/pdfs/877fbe0b4244ae2ebda304f7ba7bd6234477cc90.pdf",project_yr:"2022",project_quarter:"Fall",graphic_link:"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2014_21/452681/140519-science-cell.jpg",headline:"This paper proposes a novel machine learning model that attempts to address this problem by taking advantage of two different types of crucial data.",expand:!1,tags:["Environmentalism","Weather"],related_proj:[70,123,125]},"83b8dba6998311289d5b09fe6cd9939404c278f9":{student_name:"Anya N.",mentor_name:"Eric Bradford",mentor_title:"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Masters from MIT, Technical PM at Apple",mentor_image:"assets/images/mentor_imgs/1c6e0145b739e5e8514f37fc9548d17022d2535f.png",student_image:"assets/images/student_imgs/f0e1b36365511c70a250266b0cebedf2d30ffd98.png",domains:["Sports and Motion Sciences"],project_title:"Revolutionizing Football: Using Machine Learning to Predict Future Performances for Quarterbacks",project_desc:"Football is a largely popular American sport, and within fans of the sport, betting and fantasy football are also very popular.

Phase 1 of my research evaluated the Dimenet++ model and Graphormer 3D Transformer model on a subset of the OC20 (Open Catalyst 2020) IS2RE dataset to analyze the relationship between a 3D Transformer and a GNN, and establish a baseline model that can be used to compare to Phase 2. In addition, I trained a joint model with both OC20 and OC22 data and compared the results to the independently trained models produced earlier to evaluate joint training on model performance. However, the thermodynamic data provided by OC20 is not enough for accurate screening. Atom charge distribution is an important factor in driving the chemical reactions of electrocatalysts so it can potentially also bolster model performance, and it has not yet been included in previous models because it is calculated through DFT. Using Bader Charges calculated through DFT for atom structures in OC20, I performed feature engineering with 13 additional atomic characteristics, and constructed a Random Forest and GNN model to predict Bader charges for all atom structures. I then modified the Graphormer model to incorporate this new predicted charge attribute. The refined model saw ~3.5% less in loss and ~10% greater in EwT across all the validation splits. With this new model, electrocatalysts can be screened faster with higher accuracy at scale.",research_paper:"assets/pdfs/cb5813a6a122d09c165039fb28c40dede1d0739c.pdf",project_yr:"2023",project_quarter:"Summer",graphic_link:"https://u4d2z7k9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Untitled-683-%C3%97-1024px-1024-%C3%97-683px-2023-07-12T154605.688.jpg",headline:"Phase 1 of my research evaluated the Dimenet++ model and Graphormer 3D Transformer model on a subset of the OC20 (Open Catalyst 2020) IS2RE dataset to analyze the relationship between a 3D Transformer and a GNN, and establish a baseline model that can be used to compare to Phase 2.",expand:!0,tags:["Renewable Energy","Earth Systems"],related_proj:[120,61,64]},"4b4af9496d29d87deae52a285bf64b58f22b0c39":{student_name:"Ashwith Y.",mentor_image:"assets/images/missing_image.png",student_image:"assets/images/missing_image.png",domains:["Healthcare and Biology","Humanitarian Efforts and Social Justice"],project_title:"Predicting Mental Health Conditions Using Student Demographic Information ",project_desc:"We are working with supervised data and this is classification data.

In order to achieve this given the lack of pre-existing drone image datasets, I had to collect images, label them, and train a functional model. I collected my dataset using the DJI Mavic Mini Drone and labeled the images on Roboflow, a computer vision data labeling website. I resorted to creating my own dataset focused around 6 different classes: buildings, houses, fences, poles, street signs, and trees. Based on these goals, I picked 3 locations to take pictures: Brandywine Drive, Saratoga High School, and downtown Los Gatos. I flew my drone at a varying range of altitudes from around 5-30 meters off the ground and altered the angle of the gimbal from looking straight down (90°) to horizontal views at around (10°). Throughout the process of labeling, I did not label minute objects which did not directly affect the flight path of the drone. Hence, I did not label many trees/buildings/poles/etc. in the background where I did not find it necessary to do so. Data augmentation has been key to the success I have had throughout this project. Labeling is a lengthy process requiring excessive labor, and a quick way to easily upscale the size of my dataset was through augmentation. I used Roboflow’s threefold (3x) augmentation and ended up settling on 4 types of image-level augmentation: noise, exposure, brightness, and blur. I trained my model using transfer learning on YOLOv5, and was able to achieve proficient results. Albeit mediocre training accuracies, my models performed well on test datasets, correctly creating bounding boxes with high confidences. In the near future, I will look to increase the size of my dataset and balance the label count in order to improve my model and address the skew in my dataset.

Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in preventing severe complications, yet traditional methods often require expensive tests and equipment. Machine learning offers an innovative and more cost-efficient alternative, through pattern recognition of more lightweight data to accurately predict CVD presence and severity. In this paper, we look past traditional binary approaches to CVD diagnosis and look towards quantitative ordinal labels, where a higher number represents more severity. Using the UC Irvine Heart Disease dataset, we test six lightweight models — Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVC), and Decision Trees (DT) — alongside a custom neural network model to evaluate their performance on this multi-class classification task. Each model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are analyzed to assess robustness in clinical settings. The RF, KNN, and custom models achieved testing accuracies above 86%, with the KNN leading in accuracy, precision, and recall, going beyond the baseline LR model’s accuracy of 52%. Our findings demonstrate that lightweight models are highly effective for CVD prediction, offering potential for future deployment in AI-assisted tasks in hospitals.

Eye-tracking technology, which monitors visual attention patterns, has emerged as a potential tool for early diagnosis. Our research aimed to explore whether eye-tracking scan path images could be used to predict the presence of ASD by applying machine learning techniques. We collected eye-tracking data from individuals with ASD and non-ASD controls, processed the images to enhance clarity, and labeled them accordingly (ASD = 1, non-ASD = 0).

Early diagnosis is essential for effective intervention; however, diagnosis using X-ray imaging is difficult due to the subtlety and variability manifested in the various states of the disease. Deep learning methods, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are proposed for the automatic grading of knee arthritis into five classes: Normal, Doubtful, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. This is an artificial intelligence system that avoids the many difficulties of manual diagnosis, which are inconsistent between radiologists and very time-consuming with current methods, to increase the diagnostic accuracy and consistency, especially in developing or resource-constrained settings with limited specialist access.\n\nThe study uses transfer learning with state-of-the-art models, such as EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3, to improve the classification of arthritis severity on X-ray images. Pre-trained layers on ImageNet datasets were fine-tuned for the knee arthritis dataset by adding custom classification heads to each model. Data preprocessing methods, including resizing and normalization, were also applied to ensure uniformity throughout the dataset. Their performances were tested with the use of such metrics as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, validated against different stages in the development of arthritis. Of special note was EfficientNetB0, showing better results of up to an 85% accuracy score for this overall scenario.\n\nWhile the models showed promising results, they still struggled with the accurate classification of cases of Mild arthritis, indicating a need for further refinement. This study has brought out the potential of AI-based diagnostic tools in reducing diagnostic variability, speeding up the determination of arthritis severity, and improving patient outcomes.

People use AI to create art, but not in the ethical way that it should be used, that is, the art generated by the AI is taken and claimed as their original work. This is often the result of a lack of creativity, but it can also cause creativity to reduce as well. So, instead of using AI in a way that hinders the creative process, I wanted to use it in a way that promotes the process. My app Art Intel combines my passion for art and my interest in artificial intelligence by utilizing generative AI to serve as an ally in the creative process to solve that problem. Rather than the AI giving back an image with the fixes made, making it easy for the artist to steal it and claim it as their own, Art Intel will be by your side to guide you down the path from good art to great art, without taking away creative liberties.",research_paper:"assets/pdfs/ddb3d9503e3dd25d13972fa01442c2910d6b037b.pdf",project_yr:"2025",project_quarter:"Spring",graphic_link:"https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly/features/media_179810889bf1ef34a453137e0387dd9e0f4e43f05.jpg?width=750&format=jpg&optimize=medium",headline:"Art Intel is an app that uses generative AI to support and enhance the artistic process without replacing or undermining human creativity.
