      "project_desc": "Gender inequality is a complex subject consisting of a variety of issues and nuances. In this project, we choose to study gender income inequality—a prevalent issue in current society. Among the many factors that play a role in the gender wage gap, we focus on the affects of marital status, race, geographical location (by state), age, and years of education. By using these variables to create a model able to predict the hourly wage gap between a woman and their equivalent male counterpart, we can analyze the impact of each variable to better understand the role they play in the income gap. Utilizing income data from the Current Population Survey, we train and test five models—a Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, KNeighbors Regressor, and MLP Regressor. Our Linear Regression model found that there is a correlation between being a never married worker and a smaller gender wage gap, as well as being a married worker with an absent spouse and a greater gender wage gap. In general, though, our models found little correlation between the variables provided and the predicted hourly age gap. \n",

Thus, predicting the timing and amplitude of the peak of the incoming solar cycle 25 is of great importance. This study uses a hybrid deep learning CNN-LSTM model and observed 13-month smoothed sunspot numbers to predict Solar Cycle 25. The MinMax normalization substantially reduces the error of the CNN-LSTM model’s solar cycle predictions compared to the Standard Deviation normalization. The results suggest that it is best to use four historical solar cycles to predict the future solar cycle. The predicted Solar Cycle 25 will have a peak amplitude similar to the 13-month smoothed peak of solar cycle 24. The predicted solar cycle 25 peak spans a relatively long period of time between approximately August 2023 and July 2024. ",

This can be applied in the U.S. too, in places where the population cannot otherwise obtain loans to start small businesses and climb their way out of poverty. It can be very difficult to start from rock bottom in the US, especially for those without access to resources. If people could obtain small loans and start small businesses, they could work their way out of poverty. The microloans have to be viable for banks as well.

After testing multiple setups, the final model, based on Inception ResNet v2, differentiates between the two types of Pneumonia with a 75% test accuracy, using minimal epochs in order to increase efficiency. The model was further improved by using dropout, the implementation of early stopping, L2 regularization and augmentation of the training data in order to combat overfitting.

      "project_desc": "A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or ruptures. Consequently, part of the brain is unable to obtain the blood (and oxygen) it needs, so brain cells die. This makes it important to be able to assess the probability of a stroke given features that are specific to patients so that they could take preventative measures in the future. Thus, the unpredictability and deadliness of strokes pose the following questions: Can we predict the occurrence of a stroke from few facts about the patient easily accessible by the doctor? What are the most important features for stroke prediction? In this project, we investigate the feasibility of using a supervised machine learning model to predict stroke occurrence. In practice, however, we faced challenges such as low prevalence and the imbalance in the available dataset, with many more negative than positive cases. In this research paper, we do a parametric study of class weighting as a way to tackle imbalance during training. We then infer the most important features that should be taken into consideration for stroke prediction. Assessing feature importance allows for patients to focus on two or three areas that may be contributing to their high probability for getting a stroke. The most significant result was that the most important feature that should be considered when determining the probability of an individual getting a stroke is age. However, there is no distinct second most important feature. Additionally, a non monotonic improvement with a class weight of 22.5 for positive cases in this dataset produces the most optimal results. \n",

      "project_desc": "When physicians and pregnant patients make decisions about whether to pursue a vaginal birth or cesarean, there are many factors at play. While vaginal birth can have health benefits for both parent and child, there are significant safety risks. In order to minimize these risks, physicians use predictive models to determine how likely patients are to have successful vaginal births after cesareans (VBAC). For many years, these predictive models included race as a variable. This decision recently came under fire, and the Maternal Fetal Medicine Unit (MFMU) published a calculator that did not include race as a variable, but still predicted VBAC success with high accuracy. A large body of work in machine learning has highlighted that supposedly de-biased systems often re-code sensitive variables like race in terms of proxy variables. In order to determine if this was the case in this calculator, we replicated their formula, then found base-rate statistics of all the input variables for three different racial groups: Black, White, and Asian. We found that the distribution of VBAC probabilities for our simulated patients from these three groups were, indeed, significantly different from each other. Further, the predicted VBAC rates increased as a function of societal marginalization: Black patients were 47.6% likely to have a successful VBAC, Asian patients had a 48.6% probability, and White patients had a 49.4% probability. While these values are all within a few percentage points of each other, the differences in these simulated distributions shows how there may still be underlying disparities in the maternal healthcare system.",

      "project_desc": "Diagnosing brain tumors is challenging due to their location and varied presentations\nthat may mimic common disorders. A cancer diagnosis can be missed even when advanced imaging is conducted due to interpretive error or an incompatible clinical history as presented. Machine learning, when applied to radiological imagery, can alert physicians earlier to the presence of tumors and improve diagnostic evaluation. This enhanced evaluation can lead to earlier detection of malignant tumors and positively improve prognosis, quality of life, and treatment. This research aims to investigate the application of machine learning to enhance diagnosis. The study developed two machine learning models, a logistic regression model, and a neural network model. We hypothesized that our methods would work sufficiently, proving the correct diagnosis rate, especially within the neural networks model, as they are more complicated in nature. Applying a dataset sourced from Kaggle into the respective algorithms showcased a promising future of machine learning applications to brain tumor diagnosis, with test accuracies in the logistic regression model high (68%) and the neural network model at a significant high (84%). The simple fact of achieving a 84% accuracy rate on new data in the neural network model represents a promising future for the early detection of brain tumors.\n",

An early and accurate diagnosis is crucial in getting patients the necessary treatment and increasing survival rates. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular in the medical field due to their ability to recognize complex patterns and reduce human errors. However, accurate diagnosis using deep learning algorithms requires a large amount of training data, which is not always available. Additionally, training a model from scratch can take a long time and requires vast amounts of computational power. As a solution, this study aims to utilize a transfer learning method in which the prior knowledge of a pretrained model is used to aid in a new classification problem. In this study, a dataset of MRI images consisting of four classes (no tumor, pituitary tumor, meningioma, and glioma) were used. The performance of seven pretrained models (ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, ShuffleNet, and MobileNet) were evaluated in order to see which would achieve the highest classification accuracy. Additionally, this study examined two different methods for the implementation of transfer learning. In the first method, all layers of the pretrained model were frozen and in the second method, all layers of the pretrained model were trained. The best performing models proved to be ResNet18 and ShuffleNet with all layers trained, achieving an accuracy of 97.86%. The results also showed that the unfrozen models outperformed their frozen counterparts.  \n",

One cause of this improper disposal of materials is that it can be difficult to tell if a material is able to be recycled. In response, I created a machine learning model that can distinguish recyclable materials from trash through image classification. For my model, I used a dataset called trash-net. I first extracted the contents of the data and resized the dataset in order to have better organization. There are six categories within the dataset: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash, that the images are organized in. I used resnet34 which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to perform the image classification. Afterwards, I trained my model by running the program repeatedly and then tested it by seeing if it accurately predicted if a material was recyclable or not. Lastly, I used matplotlib to visualize the results. The accuracy of the model ended up being about 88%. Generally, if the accuracy of a machine-learning model is higher than 50% then it performs relatively well. With more training and a greater number of images, the program could potentially increase in accuracy. In conclusion, I think my model would help as it could generally classify if a material was recyclable or not. However, an application in which the user directly scans an item would be more useful. Nevertheless, my model performed well and enabled me to learn more about the use of artificial intelligence. \n\n",

A crucial step to achieving performant models is to apply data augmentation to increase the dataset size and the generalization capacity. I compare and contrast data augmentation strategies on the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) 2013 dataset to determine which method leads to a maximal increase in performance. I then examine the benefit of data augmentation at various training set sizes. Among the strategies I evaluate, I find that shifting the width of the image provides the greatest increase to performance when compared to not applying data augmentation. Furthermore, I find that at several training dataset sizes ranging from 100 to 20,000 images, applying all data augmentation strategies consistently outperforms no data augmentation. These strategies can inform the development of digital therapies for autism which focus on the evocation and subsequent automatic detection of facial expressions.",

However, the training data predominantly represents fair skinned people. The goal is to increase the accuracy of existing models in diagnosing skin disease across various skin tones within 10% of that obtained in diagnosing fairer skin tones, which is about 95.8%. The publicly available HAM10000 dataset with 10000 fair skin images was preprocessed and used to fine-tune a Vision Transformer model trained on the ImageNet-21K dataset. The model obtained about 94.9% accuracy in diagnosing fair skin images and about 19.8% accuracy in diagnosing real non-fair skin images. Next, 50% of the training data was transformed into non-fair skin simulation by CycleGAN based on 320 real non-fair images. After several iterations, the model achieved about 78.6% accuracy in classifying any skin tone and 52.1% accuracy in classifying real non-fair images. Though this 68.4% is outside of the desired range, it still falls within the accuracy of dermatologists (48–77%). However, it is the accuracy in classifying non-fair skin that makes this model significant. The model achieved a 28.6% increase in accuracy in diagnosing non-fair images using simulated data thereby narrowing the disparity.

Along with quality of life, it’s important to know if a patient has AD in order to protect them from autoimmune disorders that can worsen their symptoms or pose a threat due to their vulnerable state. We aimed to answer the question about if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, which are often used in the diagnosing of other neurological disorders, can be used to diagnose AD in patients. While neurologists have already attempted this, we wondered if we could take it a step further by using machine learning to classify the data and separate it into different categories of dementia in order to properly diagnose a patient, as well as determine the severity of their AD. While conducting this research, we found surprising results, shown in how one of our inferior models reported nearly perfect accuracy while a model that was supposed to be superior reported a significantly poorer accuracy. Overall, our models reported back accuracies over 70%. These models also had to be incredibly complicated, with the image data being put into it having to be processed through hundreds of layers if we wanted a satisfactory accuracy.

Due to imbalances in the dataset, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to compensate for limited observations of certain orbit types. Afterwards, several classification models were implemented using specific orbital features. The most accurate results in this study were produced by a custom Keras neural network, with similar results demonstrated by an MLP neural network and k-nearest neighbors model. The custom neural network was able to effectively distinguish between orbital patterns, as demonstrated by its 99.18% validation accuracy and nearly diagonal confusion matrix.

However, industry volatility and the seemingly unpredictable nature of the stock market have led many buyers to invest impulsively, sell their shares at the wrong time, or purchase stock from the wrong company. To combat these problems, we trained and tested A.I. models on our collected, classified data in order to generate accurate predictions.

      "project_desc": "Climate change is an issue that has and will affect humanity throughout the time that we are on Earth. Due to this fact, scientists have created numerous methods of modelling the climate, with mathematical models being used most widely. However, due to some limitations that these models hold, researchers have turned to utilize machine learning models to predict the future climate. This is because AI has a reputation for being able to handle complex data and recognize patterns that humans previously could not have. This study aims to create a baseline machine learning model that utilizes an Autoregressive Recurrent Neural network with a Long Short term memory implementation for the purpose of predicting climate. This type of model architecture has been utilized for other applications that relate to time series data, yet it has yet to be attempted to be used in the context of climate predictions. The data that was utilized was retrieved from the ensemble mean version of the ERA5 dataset. The model created from this study was able to predict the general trends of Earth(i.e, the poles are cold, and the equator region is warm) for both when predicting the climate and when it was predicting weather. When predicting the climate, the model was able to have fair accuracy for a long period of time, with the ability to predict seasonal patterns. This feat is one that other researchers were not able to do with the complex reanalysis data that this study has utilized. This work demonstrated that this type of model can be utilized in a climate forecasting approach as a viable alternative to mathematical models and can be utilized to supplement current work that is mostly successful in short term predictions.

      "project_desc": "Glioblastoma is the deadliest form of brain cancer which begins as a congregation of cancerous cells within the brain but then progresses into invading and destroying healthy brain tissue [9]. Radiation therapy, the most popular treatment option, is where neuro-oncologists apply intense radiation energy beams directly on the tumor region to kill the cancerous cells. However, for radiation therapy to be effective, the segmented magnetic resonance image (MRI) in which the oncologists base where to apply the radiation must be segmented nearly 100% accurately, or else the energy beams will mistakenly damage healthy brain tissue. Additionally, radiation therapy will be futile if the MRI segmentation is not complete in time for the therapy appointment. Our research problem is evaluating the performance of notable segmentation models for accurate and immediate 3D segmentation of glioblastoma multiforme brain tumors from MRIs while focusing on one particular architecture, the 3D U-Net. Each of the models was given 850 MRIs from the BraTS 2021 dataset, which is an annual competition hosted by the University of Pennsylvania [8]. Our 3D U-Net model achieved a testing accuracy of 0.986) accuracy and took approximately 55 seconds to predict segmentations of the tumor region. The results reveal that the 3D U-Net model is capable of automating glioblastoma tumor segmentation in significantly fewer hours than a human oncologist would take, all while maintaining similar or higher accuracy, where even a minor difference can mean the distinction between life and death.",

The main objective of this project was to distinguish between microlensing and non-microlensing events, the former of which could be dark matter events. Through the rigorous testing of various Artificial Intelligence models, including Linear Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, and others, we conducted a comparative analysis to discern disparities in accuracy, precision, and other recall among these models Through hyperparameter tuning and the elimination of false positives, the KNN model was confirmed to be the most accurate model, generating a 97% accuracy for the detection of microlensing events within the Milky Way.

Such people face significant challenges in their educational pursuits and therefore they often struggle in life. Can Artificial Intelligence and latest developments in technology help visually impaired people understand literary content easier? To address this question, I have developed an Artificial Intelligence based proof of concept system that accurately converts any image with textual/mathematical data into Braille and Audio mediums as close to real-time as possible. The system takes an image as input and extracts text from it through optical character recognition (OCR) using a finetuned and optimized version of opensource PaddlePaddle OCR model. The system then has two different output options, an audio-based format, and a braille-based tactile format. Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) were used as evaluation metrics to evaluate performance of the system on different types of data.  My system achieves a weighted average WER of approximately 7% with an average processing time of around 1 sec per 500 characters. The evaluation data shows that the system achieved the goal of having an accurate detection of the data in near real-time speed. My prototype outperforms much bigger and commercial models like ChatGPTv4 in terms of latency as well. This project shows that technology and AI can be an additional tool to help visually impaired people better understand educational content which can eventually uplift them in life.",

Landfill decomposition is a large contributor to this rise in methane, and certain landfills have even adopted methane capture systems that enable the conversion of this methane into valuable energy resources. To continue to mitigate these emissions, it is imperative to establish a comprehensive United States landfill database. We present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that uses image data in the United States to distinguish whether an image is a landfill or not. The model had a test accuracy of 97.1%, a precision of 96.3%, a recall of 98.1%, and an F-1 score of 97.2%.

However, figuring out how to improve soil can be a big challenge since there are so many elements and properties of soil to analyze. To help solve this problem we looked into the elements or properties of soil that could have the biggest influence on soils ability to be productive for growing crops. We found online datasets and used unsupervised machine learning by applying both principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchal clustering on our data. We concluded that calcium, potassium, pH, and soil organic carbon are the elements or properties of soil that have the biggest influence on soil's ability to be productive for growing crops. If these results are accurate, it can massively help many farmers and people in improving their soil quality. This can lead to us taking a big step in the direction of increasing Earth’s overall crop yield.  ",

Being able to develop an accurate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm would help significantly in breast cancer diagnosis since manual examination of lymph node scans is both tedious and oftentimes highly subjective. The usage of AI in the diagnosis process provides a much more straightforward, reliable, and efficient method for medical professionals and would enable faster diagnosis and, therefore, more immediate treatment. The overall approach used was to train a convolution neural network (CNN) based on a set of pathology scan data and using the trained model to binarily classify if a new scan were benign or malignant, outputting a 0 or a 1, respectively. The final model’s prediction accuracy is very high, with 100% for the train set and over 70% for the test set. Being able to have such high accuracy using an AI model is monumental in regards to medical pathology and cancer detection. Having AI as a new tool capable of quick detection will significantly help medical professionals and patients suffering from cancer.",

To address this problem, we developed a pose estimation and audio analysis approach to autonomously referee fencing bouts. Using a custom dataset of international level fencing from the last 7 years, including ~4000 unique clips, our model achieved an accuracy of 89.1%, a 20% increase over previous state-of-the-art models. This model leverages advancements in human pose estimation to extract the position of both fencers and avoids high computational loads typically associated with CNNs. Additionally, it uses a novel technique to solve the issue of blade contact, a key component of refereeing fencing that was generally unaddressed in previous works. Our novel solution uses audio to ‘listen’ for the sound of blade contact rather than attempting to identify it visually. ",

Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that can lead to many health concerns for both the mother and fetus. Machine learning classification can take many different features or inputs to guess what the output should be, so in the case of gestational diabetes, in a ML were given many medical features and had to predict what the outcome could be, someone could figure out what the ML thought was most important, and that could be an indicator of what medical factors are closely connected with a disease. I used four different machine learning models to each predict if a patient given a list of their medical features had gestational diabetes. I then found out which features the models relied on to make their guess in order to determine the most indicative medical factors. All models agreed that glucose was a medical factor that they relied on to make their predictions. Two different models had the exact same three features: glucose, BMI, and age. In conclusion, if medical professionals know that these three factors are most indicative of someone developing gestational diabetes, then these areas can be targeted when someone is trying to get pregnant to minimize the likelihood of developing gestational diabetes.",

Research in particle physics has helped us in the world of medicine, in drug development, along with exploring more about matter that makes up our world. I created a model that classifies a particle as signal or background based on given test features that I was able to get from the NASA MAGIC Gamma Telescope experiment. This was accomplished by creating an ML model and following the process of training, predicting, and evaluating to test various models. I found the accuracy score of the model, created a confusion matrix, and calculated the f1 score for all the models. For the final model, I got an accuracy score of 88.44% and an f1 score of about 0.883, allowing me to finally find a model that classifies the high energy gamma particles with the highest accuracy.

      "project_desc": "Machine learning has become a rapid and prevalent tool in the growth of environmental science. With the onset of emerging data, data analysts have relied on ML models to reveal hidden trends. In past papers, machine learning has been brought up countless times as an innovative method to rapidly sort through data in big groups. However, developing an artificial neural network model is a sparsely used tool in research due to its lack of human interface, risk factors, and not enough experimentation in real-life applications. In this research, we implemented multiple ANN models to identify factors in a water’s chemical levels to identify which has the largest weight or bias in determining whether the water is potable or not. Subsequently, we created a model that uses these parameters to analyze and predict whether a water source will be safe to drink. Water is an essential resource for all beings on Earth, and as the climate changes, the water levels rise, and along comes pollutants to once safe drinking water. By comparing the accuracy between both classifier and regressor ML models, each model was hyper-parameterized to develop a better accuracy, as well as identify the weight each parameter carries towards the potability of the source. The results demonstrate a promising conclusion that the number of solids affects the potability versus other chemical levels. That said, there was not a strong, distinct correlation and every factor plays an important part. The accuracy of these models returned a sub-par 64.77% accuracy with a 0.53 precision, a 0.46 recall score, and a 0.49 f1 score. In conclusion, while the accuracy of the models is ineffective to be used just yet on a bigger scale, they offer a stepping stone in the development of machine learning models in the environmental science fields, resourcing digital infrastructures to analyze and dissect the Earth and its trajectory through climate changes.",

First, the Zero-Shot-Learning experiment where I only provide the model with the questions from a specific lesson. This would be the equivalent of a student going into a test without studying as the model has not gathered any knowledge from the lesson. Second, the Few-Shot-Learning experiment, where I provide the model with specific lesson content from the textbook and the corresponding questions. This equates to a student skimming over the lesson content before taking the test. Lastly, I fine-tuned the Davinci model on some of the textbook questions and then fed it questions. This is similar to a student doing a thorough review of the material before taking the test. After conducting all three experiments, I compare their accuracies and in doing so, highlight the “intelligence” and limitations of GPT-3. \n",

In all of the areas that have been previously mentioned, there is a large inability to be able to identify when certain workers are feeling certain emotions, as a result of lack of recall memory, lack of honesty, or simply lack of awareness. In order to identify the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of healthcare workers, educators, video game testers and consumers of a business at certain moments, the quality of healthcare, education, video games and business websites will all increase respectively by being able to identify when workers are feeling a certain way, and how to reinforce or reduce the emotions being felt during those moments. \nIn order to solve this problem, many classification algorithms will be explored, such as convolutional neural networks, K nearest neighbor, multi-layer perceptron classifier, amongst many others. These classification algorithms will look for a successful and quality classification of the images being presented in order to ensure excellence whenever this solution is implemented in the areas mentioned previously. \n\tBy using the algorithms mentioned previously, the accuracy of the model was significantly higher than what it would have been had it been chosen randomly. For instance, with a convolutional neural network, there was an accuracy of 25%, whereas random assignment would have had a success rate of 14.29%\nThe conclusions from this investigation are that artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in order to classify images into 7 categories according to the emotion being displayed on them, and this solution can and will be successfully implemented into the areas mentioned previously. \n",

      "headline": "The goal of this research project is to predict whether or not a patient has skin cancer through a machine learning model that is developed from an image dataset. Skin cancer is extremely dangerous, as over 9500 people in the US are diagnosed with it daily. If detected early, patients will have a more likely chance of survival. I tested an MLP Classifier, Decision Tree Regressor, a Logistic Regression Model, and a KNN Model to compare various results and ultimately determine the best accuracy. The MLP Classifier had a 74.5% accuracy, the Decision Tree Regressor had a 74.1% accuracy, the Logistic Regression Model had a 68.8% accuracy, and the KNN Model had a 74.6% accuracy (all testing). We can see that the MLP Classifier, Decision Tree Regressor, and the KNN Model had around the same accuracy while outperforming the Logistic Regression Model. However, when comparing training data, there seems to be a large overfitting problem with most of the models.",

I am trying to take data about the environment and a current fire and predict where the fire will go / if it will grow or shrink. Forest fires are burning more and more each year, as evidenced by the record breaking fires in Australia in 2020. The top ten years with the largest annual acreage burnt have all happened since 2004, and forest fires are now causing 7.4 million more acres of tree cover loss per year since 2001.\nThis project would hopefully let firefighters predict where the fire is going to prevent it. The data I used was a graph of where the fire was and other features such as the surrounding wind speed, terrain, plant content, etc, and then the label comes from another graph showing where the fire moved to. I tried several different models, namely a Multi Layer Perceptron (or Neural Net), Logistic Regression and Linear Regression before settling on a CNN that predicts if each square kilometer will have a fire or not. I then was unable to get this to work so I settled on making a model that predicts how dangerous the fire will be. I was eventually able to get it to predict this with 60% accuracy. The major conclusion I had with this problem is that it is very tough but it seems like there is a way to predict where a forest fire will go. I would like to keep researching to see if I can find out how.\n",

Recidivism prediction algorithms used in courtrooms have been shown to produce unnecessarily harsh risk assessment scores against Black individuals, leading them to have more strict bail guidelines. This contributes to a greater narrative against Black Americans. In order to explore how different algorithms might be biased in predicting recidivism, we used 3 different classification models to predict whether individuals in the Virginia Felony Database dataset would recidivate. We tested three different (optimized) machine learning algorithms — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-nearest-neighbors and compared the resulting confusion matrices to determine which was the most effective. The final Logistic Regression model had a final accuracy of 70.44%; the Random Forest algorithm had the best at 75.64% and K-nearest-neighbors had 72.24%. All algorithms had a greater false positive (false arrest prediction) for white individuals, likely due to the dataset containing many examples of white criminals. In our model white defendants were discriminated against because of data bias, which demonstrates how algorithms can treat different racial groups differently depending on the data that goes in. Given historical bias, we can see how this same pattern could occur in the opposite direction favoring white individuals more frequently in other datasets.",

However, the decentralised nature of solar makes it difficult to keep track of the different photovoltaic (PV) systems deployed across a country. There is a critical need for highly accurate, comprehensive national databases of solar systems, which would allow policymakers, researchers, and the government to study socioeconomic trends in solar deployment. Manual surveys have shown to be inaccurate. The 2018 DeepSolar study by Yang et. al developed a deep-learning framework and national solar deployment database for the US using high-quality satellite imagery, which proved to be a much more efficient and accurate approach. However, satellite imagery in developing countries such as Bangladesh is of much lower resolution and quality, and performed poorly with the original DeepSolar model by Yang et. al. Our study highlights the implementation of a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) in detecting solar panels through low resolution Google Static Maps API satellite imagery data. The model was trained over 500 epochs and had 49,859,906 parameters, and classified image samples as positive (indicating presence of solar panels) or negative (absence of solar panels). Our accuracy was 86.49%, F1 score was 86.49%, precision was 91.95%, and recall score was 81.63%, which are comparable scores to the original DeepSolar CNN that was trained on much higher quality data. This was the first CNN to detect solar panels using low-resolution satellite imagery (which is usually the only option for developing countries), and showed to be highly accurate and computationally efficient. Future plans include gathering funding to be able to purchase Google API satellite imagery to be able to cover all of Bangladesh to create a comprehensive public national database, as well as expanding to other developing countries.",

      "project_desc": "WIth the diversity of research methods and measurement instruments found in astronomy, it is often difficult to draw direct comparisons between conclusions due to differences in both kind and quality of measurements.   By using a machine learning algorithm we have been able to predict measurements that may not have been gathered, notably , the iron content of a star based upon temperature or gravity readings. The problem has not been answered before with this data set, and the scientific community does not have a large amount of research that has pertained to this specific APOGEE data release. By addressing this previously unaddressed problem, we can advance the scientific community with a new contribution that allows scientists of the future to gain additional data in conditions where such data may not be so readily available. We have approached the question by using various machine learning algorithms to discover correlations between the data points we were given, creating a predictive model to produce a numerical result. Gravity and temperature do not present a direct linear relationship to the iron content of a star. However, as their data points tend to cluster together, we can utilize the KNeighborsRegressor to find correlations in the way that these points have, and produce a numerical prediction. Throughout testing we’ve found that the KNeighborsRegressor does better on all accounts in comparison to a large variety of other regression models such as the GaussianProcessRegressor. Considering the results of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error function upon the results of both of these, we can note how the LinearRegressor, mathematically, does marginally better than the KNeighborsRegressor, at a value of 1.13% of average error in comparison to 2.53%.

However, too often people focus on a predetermined area and scale, overlooking the fact that COVID doesn’t flow into or out of just one area but instead spreads everywhere simultaneously. Thus, we propose novel approaches to process the infection rates of all states in the United States as a whole while taking into account the interconnectivity between states through domestic flights. We introduce 1) the graph attention LSTM for analyzing domestic flights across states, 2) the image attention LSTM for understanding infection rates from United States COVID heat maps, and 3) the attention bottleneck mid fusion model that integrates graph and image attention LSTMs. Through tests that require simultaneous predictions of the infection rates in all US states, we compare the performances of our methods with those of classic sequence-processing methods and achieve significantly more accurate results.",

A solar flare is typically accompanied with a coronal mass ejection (CME), in which a highly magnetic plasma is released from the sun’s corona into the heliosphere. CMEs are capable of reaching earth and colliding with the earth’s magnetic field, causing dangerous geomagnetic storms that can start fires and cause power outages. It is imperative that flares are studied so that actions can be taken to mitigate the effect of geomagnetic storms. Our data was sourced from the RHESSI telescope which consisted of almost 100,000 entries. It was shown in Fletcher’s paper that there exists a correlation between radial distance and the energy of a flare. We began with classifying solar flares based on their radial distances and then applying machine learning models like logistic regression, KNN classification, Decision Trees and MLP Classification and closely examining the ones that gave the highest accuracy. Our different machine learning models showed that there existed a pattern in the phenomena of solar flares and our AI could be used to predict them accurately. Most notably, the decision tree model had an accuracy of 99.84%.\n",

It has always been assumed that a better physiology allows players to succeed in all sports, but I wanted to see if this was the case for volleyball. From previous research done by Sciendo, it has been shown that height is a core value for volleyball players, as it has a higher chance of helping a player succeed if they are taller. Although this is the case, they also found that Japanese volleyball players, who were shorter than the average professional volleyball player, were able to succeed and play at a high level. The overall approach used to answer this question was to see if there was any correlation between a player’s Ranking and their physiology (height, weight, spike, and block). I used a dataset named “Best Volleyball Players 2019” from Kaggle that displayed a wide range of women’s volleyball players and their different attributes along with their ranking. From the results that I have collected, the major conclusions in relation to my main question was that a person’s physiology did not affect their performance and ranking. The number for my error was large, meaning that you did not need to have a more optimal physiology to succeed in volleyball and be higher on the rankings. ",

According to Computer Science.org, while African Americans and Latinos make up 13.4% and 16% of the US population respectively, they only comprise 9% and 7% of STEM occupations (McGee). In this paper, I sought to answer the question, “How do races and genders differ in the way they pursue STEM, and what factors correlate with these differences?” Identifying which factors cause this lack of representation is the most important step in fixing the diversity problem. \n\nTo answer this question, I used data from the High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS), which asked hundreds of questions at different points throughout students’ high school and college careers. I used 16 of these questions and analyzed how strongly they correlate with pursuing a STEM career or not pursuing a STEM career. I found that Asians are much more likely to pursue STEM, African Americans are much less likely to pursue STEM, and women are much more likely to pursue STEM, although they largely pursued health occupations within STEM.\n\nIt is important that we make sure everyone feels comfortable pursuing or not pursuing STEM. From my literature review, I found that Asians are more likely to and African Americans are less likely to pursue STEM because Asians feel like they fit in and African Americans feel like they don’t (Milgrom-Elcott). In order to increase the diversity in the STEM workforce, we need to make sure all minority groups feel welcomed in high school STEM classes, college STEM courses, and STEM workplaces themselves.\n",

We created a system of translating IPA representation to vectors that captures characteristics of phonemes such as their articulatory location, and experimented with several machine learning models to capture existing trends from Old, Middle to Modern Chinese (Mandarin). Then we attempted to predict future Mandarin pronunciations based on existing phonological data and ancient reconstructions. The models were successful at capturing trends of Ancient to Modern Chinese shifts, as a great majority of the validation results were exactly correct. The predictions from the models vary in consistency of outputs and phonological inventory, but they are largely logical and may offer insight into future shifts. Therefore it is possible to predict phonological changes with machine learning, yet the accuracy of the predictions still needs validation in the future. If the predictions are proven to be effective in the future, the solutions may provide a method of capturing phonological changes and validating previous ancient reconstructions. ",

To assess the image data, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) which uses a series of neurons to output a result which we can interpret to identify the given insect. The highest validation accuracy we received was approximately 80%, which given the very subtle differences between the insects we used, the amount of categories we were defining from, and the limited number of images in each category, was a decently high validation accuracy. From this, we could conclude that we can not only identify a species, but with relatively high accuracy, giving us insight into how insect identification is a valid and applicable process which can be implemented into agricultural and pest control technology.

      "project_desc": "Our research topic addresses the issue of whether or not an AI algorithm can be developed  to forecast whether or not a criminal would recidivate by removing protected characteristics from models in terms of both accuracy, precision and recall and their equality across different groups, as well as if such a tool is necessary. The background of this issue is that there is always an underlying human prejudice present in the criminal justice system when it comes to making judgments, thus it is crucial to determine whether or not this human bias is required while making these decisions and whether there is similar kind of bias with machine learning methods. There are various ways to approach and respond to this topic, but the strategy we used involved examining the key variables that might influence prejudice, such as gender or ethnicity, and comparing how well the AI system can predict whether someone is likely to recidivate with or without incorporating these protected characteristics. The research's significant findings are that, after utilizing a number of different models, logistic regression was used to determine whether or not an offender was likely to recidivate. The accuracy of the predictions for our logistic regression model was 67.74 percent without the removal of any protected characteristics that hold risk of being discriminated against unfairly, but it increased to 68.16 percent when race and gender were taken into account. The random Forest model revealed that, after accounting for the gender characteristic, the mean absolute error—the percentage of variance between each measurement and the quantity's actual value—was 34.06 percent along with an accuracy score of 65.94 percent. The main results drawn from this demonstrate that utilizing various models and measuring the precision, recall, and accuracy of each race and gender are comparable with or without protected characteristics. Although the accuracy of this still isn't the finest, it could demonstrate that bias may not be as significant a factor in decision-making as it may first appear. This, however, can also be contested because the dataset utilized to train these models could be encoding real world bias such that race and gender get encoded into other variables such as prior offenses; this would mean that even if we removed race and gender data it would still be present in our model through other variables. The question of whether or not we should remove protected characteristics is required and needed remains unanswered as a result.",

      "project_desc": "The research problem that this research paper attempts to address is, How did Covid impact and affect the test scores of different demographics of students in various schools in New York? This issue is significant for the following reasons. By the conclusion of the school year, students had an average of five months’ worth of math and four month’s worth of reading behind them, according to an analysis of the pandemic’s effects on K-12 student learning. For example, student testing in 2021 was about ten points behind in math and nine points behind in reading, compared with matched students in previous years. The pandemic expanded already-existing achievement and opportunity inequities, particularly harming historically underprivileged students. Children in low-income schools had seven months of unfinished arithmetic work at the end of the year, compared to six months for students in majority-Black schools. High school students are now more likely to drop out, and seniors, particularly those from low-income households, are less likely to continue their education after graduation. The crisis also had an effect on pupils’ general health and well-being, with more than 35% of parents expressing severe or great concern for their kids’ mental health. The effects of the epidemic pose a threat to the hopes and possibilities for this generation far into adulthood. Their chances of enrolling in college and subsequently securing a rewarding profession that allows them to sustain a family may be adversely affected by the knock-on effects. Furthermore, analysis indicates that the pandemic’s effects on schooling may result in today’s students earning $49,000 to $61,000 less in their lifetime unless measures are implemented to remedy unfinished learning. The overall approach that was used to answer this question involved using statistical analysis to examine the correlation between how certain factors such as being economically disadvantaged or being hispanic affected student proficiency scores on New York State regents exam tests in 2018 and 2021 in different schools. Some of the significant results that came out of this research paper involved certain demographics such as those who were economically disadvantaged and those who were white. Specifically, in relation to how their demographic correlated with their school’s percent proficiency difference in a subject exam between the years 2018 and 2021. For example, 100% of the students of the Academy for Language and Technology are economically disadvantaged and compared to 2021, the number of students who were proficient in English dropped by 49%. Furthermore, 72% of Akron High school’s students are economically disadvantaged and compared to 2021, the number of students who were proficient in English dropped by 68%. However, on the other side of the spectrum, students of white descent did not fare as badly. For instance, Adirondack Middle School has an approximate demographic makeup of 100% white students. Their student’s percent proficiency when it came to their Algebra I score did not change at all. Additionally, Yonkers Montessori Academy has a demographic makeup where 46% of its students are white. The students from this school showed a 5% increase in their proficiencies in their science scores. The research that was conducted as the basis for this paper was done in an effort to examine the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on student performance across various schools in New York. Specifically, it affected some demographics disproportionately when compared to others. Due to students being forced to learn from home, some without the necessary technology and adequate resources. Consequently, a lot of students took a significant hit to their academic progress. For instance, 100% of a student’s demographic make up is economically disadvantaged and out of these students, 49% of them were no longer proficient in ELA after the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas, students of white descent did not fare as badly.  For instance, Adirondack Middle School has an approximate demographic makeup of 100% white students. Their student’s percent proficiency when it came to their Algebra I score did not change at all.",

A student’s experience at school is one of, if not, the largest contributors to the likelihood that they drop out. However, with the growing quantity of students in school, and the sheer variety of those who drop out, manually pinpointing possible dropouts becomes extremely challenging. Therefore, by using a machine learning model, administrators would be able to more efficiently identify a possible dropout and provide the necessary resources to ensure their success. The data, acquired from the UCI Machine Learning Depository, had 24 inputs, and 3630 samples. For this particular project, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Extra Trees Classifier, and an MLP Neural Network models were tested. Among these models, the most accurate was the Extra Trees Classifier model, with a percentage accuracy of 77.41%, a loss of 7.85, and an F1 score of 82.35%. With the accuracy provided, this model should be held in high regard as it serves as an efficient method for predicting possible college dropouts in university.",

In this research paper, an effective and accurate artificial intelligence NLP model is tried to be determined by evaluating various models and methods for title generation. Titles are a vital part of any work. People tend to struggle to find good titles for their work, including researchers. A title must be representative of the whole paper and its topic, so it must be carefully chosen. Titles are the main reason people read a paper, so it’s very important to attract the audience of the researcher. Apart from this, normalizing research paper titles with generated ones can eliminate bias and exaggeration from them. To determine an accurate and effective model, various methods for title generation were tested given the abstract of a research paper. The methods tested vary from very simple, like “bag of words”, to complex with GPT-2. The best result was getting a sentence similarity of 0.9032, which was 66% higher than the initial model. Through this project it is confirmed that generating good titles with NLP is a hard task, but the results from the models can facilitate the process of creating a good and compact research paper title.",

The classification was done based on measurements of the object’s redshift and its u,g,r,i, and z light emissions. Logistic regression offered the least accurate results, with an overall accuracy of 94.83%, and a runtime of 28.2 seconds. Better in both aspects was the decision tree classifier, with an overall accuracy of 98.90%, and a runtime of 6.36 seconds. Several structures with different kinds of neuron-layer arrangements were tried for the MLP classifier. While all yielded around a 98% total accuracy, the more complex a structure was, or the more nodes and layers it had, the more time it took to run, and none even came close to the low amount of time taken by the decision tree classifier.\n",

Although typology is most commonly seen in pop psychology and used for fun, typing backed by more empirical evidence and less by self-reported answers, which rely solely on the self-awareness and unbiasedness of the person, could give a more accurate insight into how people fit into the theory of cognitive functions, which MBTI is based on.  This project aims to lessen the reliance of self-report for personality typology through an artificial intelligence algorithm that can type people as one of the 16 MBTI types using an unedited writing sample by that person. The model used in this project is a transformer model, and the dataset used is a Kaggle dataset consisting of 8000 people’s personality types and 50 written samples from each person. The results are presented through a Streamlit app that uses the model to assign a personality type according to inputted text.  The accuracy measured while testing this model is approximately 57.64%, which means the model correctly classified over half the text samples it was tested on.  This indicates that there is a pattern that the model is picking up on, other than complete chance, that connects a person’s writing to their MBTI type. However, the writing is not 100% predictive of the person’s personality type.",

By using a machine learning algorithm, we have been able to create a tool that can detect what type of material an item is and determine whether it is recyclable or not. This tool can be applied to many different industry sectors, whether it is sorting items in a recycling plant, building it into an app for people to use day to day, or even aiding the plastic oceans cleanup effort. By creating this tool, we help do our part in protecting our planet and helping those who are less educated in the field to do so as well. We have approached the problem by using various machine learning algorithms to identify the material of items in a dataset. Using a KNN and CNN algorithm, we created a tool that became more and more accurate in identifying the material of an item. After testing the KNN and the CNN algorithm, we found that the CNN algorithm was much more accurate reaching a 68 % accuracy compared to 46% accuracy ",

We compared several regression models to see which would predict the price best. The random forest regressor predicted the price with about 27% away from the price on average. The SGD regression predicted the price with an error of about 42%. Our model wasn’t very accurate when predicting the price.

To achieve these objectives, we trained different machine learning models using a data set of eye-state classification from Kaggle. We analyzed the results to assess the accuracy of a KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) model. With the model achieving an accuracy of 95.23% in detecting eye movement in patients. These findings suggest that the model could be effectively utilized in the future, with further research to assist individuals with disabilities. Overall, our research suggests that it is possible to recognize eye movement through EEG results reliably. Further research in this area could lead to the development of more effective and personalized interventions for individuals with poor hand-eye coordination.",

The need for developing a machine learning model that can detect these runaway stars is established in this research as it attempts to expand the domain of astrophysics to help astrophysicists understand tidal tail formation and the theoretical dark matter subhalos’ effects on celestial bodies. Data from the ESA’s Gaia DR 3 was utilized and noise was removed through data cleaning with 4 parameters: RAdeg, DEdeg, PM, and Distance that were then factored into a K-means clustering algorithm, which created the star clusters. These 4 factors were subsequently compared and analyzed in various scatterplots. The findings revealed the model’s success in identifying potential candidates of runaway stars by confirming the existence of high proper-motion stars amongst other more similar proper-motion stars and the ability for stars to be separate by vast distances across their cluster, indicating possible tidal tails. Future improvements to work around various limitations encountered throughout this research focus on the development of a hybrid clustering-nueral network model to automatically detect and predict the likelihood of runaway stars from their clusters.

By using a machine learning algorithm, the error in these classifications is reduced significantly, and the process is made much more efficient. To approach this problem, we have implemented an Inception Resnet, which is a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network. The final model is able to determine the presence of a possible brain tumor as well as distinguish the type between three different classes. These classes include pituitary, meningioma, and glioma. Pituitary tumors are the most harmless of the three as they are noncancerous. The five year survival rate for a patient with a pituitary tumor is 97%. This contrasts greatly with both glioma and high grade meningioma tumors which are life-threatening [2]. It should be noted, however, that high grade meningioma tumors are very rare. Along with these three classes, a separate control class with no brain tumors was also used. After training the model on these four classes, the results were found to be impressive, as the final accuracy was at 96.7%. ",

The overall approach taken to achieve this goal came in the form of two parts: object detection and natural language processing (NLP). The first part contained training the AI on certain categories of objects which would then be put through the second part of the AI, the translation. The user would also be able to interact with the AI by inputting their own data and selecting a certain language they would like to learn. The AI was seen to have around a 35% accuracy rate in determining the correct image but had a few errors when encountering the translation side of things.

We wanted the model to be accurate in both short-term and long-term conditions. Our current algorithms, while highly accurate in the short term, struggle in the long-term timespan. The importance of accuracy in this model can be boiled down to two main points; convenience, for planning activities, and safety, as perhaps an early warning system in the event of a possibly harmful or fatal weather event. Our method of achieving these goals was to  first use a logistic regression model, and later a random forest classifier. In the end we reached a highest accuracy of 83%, which fell just short of our goal of 85%. Despite the inaccuracy, our model showed promising results, and if we had more time or a larger dataset, the accuracy could have been higher. In the end, the results seemed more to be a proof of concept, rather than a demonstration of accuracy and capability. ",

This agent-environment interaction is called the Markov Decision Process, and is the heart of reinforcement learning. This is an important problem to solve as reinforcement learning applications like these can be used to improve the safety and quality of life for people who are regularly traveling. Additionally, the fact that reinforcement learning can be used to solve problems like these implies further applications in complex fields like flight and other modes of transportation. To figure out how to train a plane to land, we used OpenAI Gym to build a simulated environment where we tested different landing maneuvers. Initially, we experimented with optimizing the angle of attack for variables like time taken to land and descent rate, but ultimately found it most effective to optimize for having the lowest velocity when the plane reaches the ground. Further research could potentially experiment with how different variables such as speed, acceleration, and angles of the left and right ailerons affect the plane’s landing.",

Our research question is centered around predicting stroke susceptibility and determining which demographic and medical factors significantly increase or decrease that risk. Stroke research in the past has been centered around determining the presence of a stroke using CT imaging after it has occurred; our goal was to determine likelihood of stroke prior to a stroke occurrence in order to prepare patients for and proactively address stroke risk. As such, a deep learning model was developed for stroke prediction and tested on a dataset of 5110 samples. Hyperparameters such as operating point, learning rate, batch size, and epoch value were tuned to maximize model efficiency. The model had an overall accuracy of 0.74, accurately determining 660/954 stroke negative samples and 41/54 stroke positive samples, producing recalls of 0.68 and 0.76 respectively. Overall, it was found that age played the largest role in stroke susceptibility with a correlation value of 0.25. While it was found that medical factors played a larger role in stroke proneness than lifestyle factors, the correlation between average glucose level, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke risk and the correlation between marriage status and stroke risk remained similar at 0.13 and 0.11. Our results indicate the potentiality of the use of AI in determining stroke risk based solely on collected medical and lifestyle data.",

Although many community leaders have proposed that language barriers pose significant obstacles to Census outreach, this paper explores the viability of using predictive models to quantify the extent the role language plays. By using a multivariable regression model trained on student data from the Civil Rights Data Collection, we concluded that Limited English Proficient (LEP) Asian populations were undercounted by over 98,000 people, LEP Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander populations were undercounted by over 73,000 people, and LEP White populations were undercounted by over 164,000 people.  However, biases in the dataset made the results for other ethnic groups unreliable, indicating that regression modeling should be used as a tool for identifying areas of improvement in the Census rather than producing an exact estimate of the population. Our data suggests a strong correlation between language proficiency and Census undercounts, and the Census Bureau could ideally use the results to create targeted language outreach programs for specific states.\n\t\n",

They help current diagnosis of these diseases, as clinics use the external behavior of a patient and the psychiatrist’s qualitative reasoning to determine what disease the patient has. However, this approach does not examine internal activity in the brain, and is not uniformly quantifiable. EEG provides a means for psychiatrists to do this, however, this process can be complicated because the variability in EEG signals. Machine Learning (ML) provides a means to analyze these complex data. A computational tool that can recognize patterns in EEG signals would be a valuable starting point in diagnosis psychiatric disorders. We proceeded to develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) model structure that could analyze an individual’s brain waves and predict their emotional condition. We used the EEG Brainwave Dataset: Feeling Emotions dataset, which contains various statistical features of the EEG brain waves of two different test subjects as they were experiencing different emotions. We extracted frequency domain features, converted them to the time domain, and filtered them. We trained a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model from these filtered and attained a 96.95% validation accuracy.",

      "project_desc": "As the demand for mental healthcare increases, more people have turned to mental health chatbots and other AI-powered teletherapy options. While these chatbot applications expand access to care that is often expensive and stigmatized, they also pose some cybersecurity risks. Some chatbot applications use phone sensors and other device data to make predictions about the severity of a patient’s mental illness. While this makes these predictions more accurate, they might compromise user trust. In this paper, we are trying to find which data we should collect from the user’s phone to minimize the amount of data being collected but also collecting adequate information to predict their mental health score. This is important because users are not fully trusting the mobile apps since they are afraid the apps might track all of their personal information. If we determine which data is actually necessary, we can build better user trust while maintaining the efficacy of a chatbot. The overall approach was to first collect the data that was deemed useful, such as education, sensing, survey, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data, and then found how the accuracy of the scores would decrease when each category of data collected was removed to determine the most important category to collect, as well as what combination of categories yielded the highest accuracy. The most significant result was that when we didn’t include the data from the surveys, the accuracy went down significantly. The major conclusions are that not every detail from a user’s phone will need to be collected in order to yield accurate results, and in fact, simply asking users about their daily experiences allows for far more accurate results than on-device measures.",

In 2020, despite the COVID19 pandemic greatly reducing road traffic, about 32 people died per day in the US alone from DUI (Driving under Influence)(nhtsa.gov). Existing solutions such as police testing drivers suspected to be under influence is simply impractical considering the number of possible intoxicated drivers. With more and more people gaining access to a vehicle, it is crucial that more effective strategies be developed to detect and combat drunk driving. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether Artificial Intelligence can be used to more effectively detect and prevent drunk driving and if a Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree can be more accurate than a human police officer. To address this question, a dataset named drunkImagesWebp was used. Two machine learning algorithms, Logistic regression and decision tree were then trained on this dataset with facial image data of intoxicated people to accurately predict the sobriety of humans based on facial cues. After testing this model, it became clear that both Logistic regression and decision tree models can indeed accurately test a driver for signs of intoxication with well over 90% accuracy compared to human-administered tests with can only hit up to around 75% accuracy. By comparison, both the Logistic regression and Decision tree algorithms detected intoxication with 96% accuracy. This paper shows the potential AI can have in creating an automated solution to detecting and ultimately preventing drunk driving. ",

      "project_desc": "Air pollution, notably nitrogen dioxide (NO2), poses severe health and environmental risks. The main sources of NO2 are related to transportation and stationary fuel combustion sources [U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2018]. With a global shift to electric vehicles (EVs), their potential to mitigate pollution is becoming prominent. In India, where air quality concerns are paramount, understanding the tangible benefits of EV adoption is crucial. The research question explores whether increasing EVs adoption can visibly reduce NO2 levels. The approach combines use of various supervised machine learning models and simulations to understand the impact of socio-economic factors,  adoption of electric vehicles, energy generations and emission factors on the NO2 levels and to  create a model to predict the level of NO2.  The created model will be used to estimate the impact different EV adoption levels can have on NO2. To train the model, data from 49 US states along with 5 Indian states where EV sales are comparable and the NO2 data was available has been used. Among diverse algorithms tested, the Neural Network turns out to be the best which predicts NO2 levels with a R2 value of 0.82. Simulations, varying EV numbers while holding other factors steady, demonstrated a clear link between higher EV count and lower NO2 levels. The results not only validate the potential of electric vehicles as catalysts for improving air quality but also highlight their crucial role within the Indian context, especially in the state of  Delhi which we have used as our case study. The empirical evidence underscores the pivotal contribution that EVs could make to enhancing Delhi’s air quality profile. In conclusion, the research provides substantial evidence that the widespread adoption of electric vehicles holds promise as an effective strategy to reduce NO2 levels, thereby laying the foundation for a more sustainable and healthier urban environment.",

      "project_desc": "Did you know that each day about 100-130 billion potentially cancerous cells undergo cell death? Every day, each person’s body prevents tumors from growing, and it’s all thanks to the p53 protein suppressor. Coded by the TP53 gene, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is responsible for signaling the cell repair and/or cell apoptosis pathway when damaged DNA growth is detected. In over 50% of human cells, the code for the p53 protein is corrupted, reducing its ability to inhibit tumor growth. When tumorous cells are present, there can be an overexpression of the MDM2 protein. The MDM2 protein is a protein that suppresses the activity of p53 making it even harder for controlling the potential development of cancer.\n\nThis research project targets the interaction between the MDM2 and p53 proteins to find out the most efficient ligands, or small molecules, that can bind to MDM2 and prevent the inhibition of p53 so as to stimulate the opportunity for p53 to signal for cell repair/death. This was accomplished by pre-processing a dataset of known MDM2-p53 inhibition ligands from chEMBL using Numpy/Pandas and adding necessary features into the dataset from rdKit. The processed data was then ran through a Sklearn regression model to accurately predict the efficiency of the ligands or the negative log of their Standard Value (binding efficiency).\n\nOverall, the model was able to perform quite well after optimization; however, it would produce even more accurate results if the images consisting of each ligand’s molecular structure could be processed as well since it would allow for a greater variety of features to draw patterns between. \n\nFor further research, this project will be expanded into predicting new ligands through given features based on the efficiency of known ligands with specific features. This, if accurate, would aid in discovering new ligands for cancer therapy and drug administration.",

One of the key elements of a successful Instagram post is a catchy caption that enhances the visual content and engages the audience. However, coming up with a good caption can be challenging, especially for users who are not native speakers of the language or lack creativity. In this paper, we propose an automatic caption generator that takes an image as input and generates an Instagram-style caption using state-of-the-art language models.",

Current prediction methods use direct weather observation and algorithmic computer models, while they are not very computationally intensive, they lack in their ability to maintain accurate predictions.  Machine learning has been showing some promising results with generative networks proving to show the most promise. This paper proposes a novel machine learning model that attempts to address this problem by taking advantage of two different types of crucial data. My proposed architecture combines three distinct Machine Learning models: a Recurrent Deep Neural Network, a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, and a Transformer Generative Adversarial Network to leverage numerical and visual data. While my research is purely theoretical at this stage, I believe that my proposed machine learning architecture has the potential to pave the way for future studies and practical implementations in the field of supercell thunderstorm prediction, providing significant improvements in forecast accuracy and lead time. \n",

On a certain day, a player may perform better because of the weather. On another day, that player may perform poorly because of an injury. Similarly, yearly stats also fluctuate. A quarterback may throw for 5,000 yards one year, and the next year they may throw for 3,000 yards. Due to this, it is important to have a reliable application that can aid users of betting and fantasy football in which players they should put bet on, or choose for their fantasy teams. My motivation behind this project was to create something that could further betting and fantasy football, and even increase traction. My approach to doing this was putting together dataframes of yearly statistics from 75 quarterbacks, and seeing if my linear regression model could predict statistics for a future season. Reliable sources such as the NFL website, or ESPN, were used in order to put these statistics together. The main objective was to produce as accurate as possible stats, which came over time as more seasons were added, and the code was tweaked. ",

Some of the most important population demographics include total population, crude birth rate(CBR - births/1000 people), crude death rate(CDR - deaths/1000 people), and populations of different age groups and genders. These help provide a basis into understanding the overall population growth and stage of development of a particular country, which can ultimately be used to shape economic, political, and social policies for different nations around the world. In this research project, I used multiple machine learning models(neural network and linear regression) in order to predict key demographic statistics over the next 5 years for each nation. These models yielded accurate results, as most sets of predictions had accuracy scores above 0.85. Additionally, using advanced visualization techniques, I modeled these predictions using popular human geography models such as population pyramids and demographic transition models. I found that for more developed nations such as countries in Western Europe and East Asia, the population of older individuals is going to rise significantly over the coming years. For less developed nations such as those in Africa, the overall population is going to skyrocket, and the proportion of young adults who will enter the labor force will significantly surge. In terms of real-world implications, these results could lead to more developed nations starting to spend more on social security and less developed nations starting to implement policies that limit population growth.",

Our hypothesis for the project was that even though there was a boost to U.S. corporate profits after COVID-19 due to re-opening of the economy and through government aid, these gains were completely offset by the much stronger factor of supply chain inefficiencies, thus bringing these profits down.  Our results show that supply chain inefficiencies have begun to abate worldwide and as they do, growth in corporate profits continues to stabilize to pre-pandemic levels.",

Stroke remains a pervasive health concern, with one in six deaths from cardiovascular disease attributed to it in 2021. Every 40 seconds in the United States, an individual experiences a stroke, emphasizing the urgent need for accurate prediction methods. Our study leveraged diverse machine learning models, necessitating dataset balancing prior to model evaluation. Subsequently, a comparison of metrics and fine-tuning of hyperparameters culminated in the selection of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as the optimal model. The KNN exhibited notable performance metrics, achieving an accuracy score of 80%, a recall score of 89.2%, an F1 score of 83.3%, and a precision score of 78.1%. These metrics signify the model's proficiency in correctly identifying stroke cases, its sensitivity to true positives, and its balance between precision and recall. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning models, particularly the KNN, in stroke detection, suggesting its viability for integration into medical consultations. However, the gravity of stroke as a life-threatening condition necessitates rigorous testing on larger and more recent datasets to ensure robustness and reliability in clinical applications. It should also be noted that changing the BMI, average glucose level, and age of the patient affected model performance the most.",

The AI prediction varied between a miss of 40cm all the way to 100 cm throughout all models. But After hyper tunneling the model, it got to a closely stable average of 17 cm off the real height. Although being off 17 cm is not respectable in the Medical World, this may prove that with higher ends of data, height prediction may be applicable to medical use. ",

Towards this goal, we needed to understand the changes in food production, land use, efficiency, and pricing of these commodities in a sample of different countries. Given the rampant food insecurity heavily influenced by climate change, aiding in reducing the impacts of climate change could be a crucial step towards alleviating food insecurity. Our approach to answering this question was to first gather and analyze data and then use an univariate ARIMA model for time series to further develop our hypothesis and figure out if it was possible to predict future trends. Despite not including external factors like world conflicts, inflations, weather, and trade, the univariate ARIMA is able to predict the prices, production, and efficiency well on some commodities for some countries. Our major conclusions were that our research could be used to make cursory predictions for future values of the food prices and agricultural emissions. ",

Each of these models process bank account registration information to instantly determine the legitimate versus fraudulent status of an account, expediting the bank account flagging process, saving banks internal resources and protecting bank clients from fraudulent activities. The highest performing models are ensemble models such as the gradient boosting classifier and the random forest classifier, each having accuracy scores above 90%.

However, current methods of predicting cotton yield remain significantly unreliable since they rely on human assumption. Additionally, these forecasts are significantly impacted by climate change. This paper aimed to use spatial models to better predict cotton yield. Prior papers on predicting cotton production have yielded fair results utilizing non-spatial models [1]. Therefore, the focus of this study was to use Geospatial Linear Regression to predict cotton yield. Through this study, it was found that using climate, temporal, and geographic data cohesively produces the most accurate predictions. Additionally, the Random Forest model, with an MSE of 2.67, performed better than the Geospatial model, with an MSE of 8.22. This concludes that non-spatial models are better for predicting state-wide cotton yield when compared to spatial models. This research provides valuable results to the agriculture setting as well as different aspects to further this research. ",

Proteins carry different functions in living organisms, which are often associated with their location inside eukaryotic cells. Experimental approaches for localizing proteins such as green fluorescent protein and microscopic detection are costly and time-consuming. Thus, computational methods have been adopted to facilitate this process by generating accurate predictions. This research explores various machine learning models to predict protein subcellular localization using UniProt’s Swiss-Prot database and Meta’s high-performing ESM2 structural embeddings. We extracted our dataset’s protein embeddings from ESM2’s model code publicly posted on GitHub. Multiclassification Scikit-learn models were trained and tested to achieve optimal predictions. Our best-performing model, a weighted 4-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, yielded a 57% accuracy and a MacroF1 score of 66%. Our classifier outperformed past state-of-the-art algorithms (such as Deeploc2.0) on several but not all metrics. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of machine learning in producing unprecedented advancements in the proteomics field.",

      "project_desc": "In order to develop green hydrogen into a viable source of renewable energy that can be produced and stored at scale to address climate change, cost effective electrocatalysts (catalysts that facilitate the reaction of electrolysis), are imperative. Current simulation based efforts, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), to screen such catalysts are too computational intensive and not scalable. To address this, ML models have been developed that predict the total relaxed energy of catalyst structures, a key attribute that drives chemical reactions. Phase 1 of my research evaluated the Dimenet++ model and Graphormer 3D Transformer model on a subset of the OC20 (Open Catalyst 2020) IS2RE dataset to analyze the relationship between a 3D Transformer and a GNN, and establish a baseline model that can be used to compare to Phase 2. In addition, I trained a joint model with both OC20 and OC22 data and compared the results to the independently trained models produced earlier to evaluate joint training on model performance. However, the thermodynamic data provided by OC20 is not enough for accurate screening. Atom charge distribution is an important factor in driving the chemical reactions of electrocatalysts so it can potentially also bolster model performance, and it has not yet been included in previous models because it is calculated through DFT. Using Bader Charges calculated through DFT for atom structures in OC20, I performed feature engineering with 13 additional atomic characteristics, and constructed a Random Forest and GNN model to predict Bader charges for all atom structures. I then modified the Graphormer model to incorporate this new predicted charge attribute. The refined model saw ~3.5% less in loss and ~10% greater in EwT across all the validation splits. With this new model, electrocatalysts can be screened faster with higher accuracy at scale.",

New techniques that span far beyond the conventional method of using electromagnetic radiation to identify and study astronomical evidence have been discovered and are now amplified using machine learning technology.  One such technique is using interferometers to record gravitational waves released from astronomical events.  Using computer vision to analyse gravitational waves can provide valuable information about previously obscured information. Also, gravitational waves are fundamentally unrelated to electromagnetic radiation thereby providing us with information that is entirely different from what we previously could access. This has consequentially opened an altogether new avenue for research and further exploration. The contrastive model for machine learning-based detection and classification performed the best. \n",

Doing this could allow for faster predictions than compiling and properly testing a given program, especially with high compile-time optimization, allowing for faster optimization of a program. To accomplish this, we trained a model consisting of a TreeLSTM and an MLP on a dataset sourced from CodeChef in order to predict the time and memory taken by a given program. After training, we received an average percent error of 22.43% and 1261.07% for time and memory respectively which is fairly poor overall but somewhat fine for the time. As such, this paper concludes that machine learning can potentially be used to accomplish this goal but would likely need a more involved and thought through implementation to work effectively.",

However, preventative measures such as yoga have been found to prevent NCDs as well as mediate Adrenomedullin(ADM) levels, a biomarker for NCDs, in practitioners. While this relationship has been studied, I plan to study how yoga can aid an individual’s efforts to lower their ADM levels. I did this by creating and tuning four regression models that predicted a patient’s ADM levels after doing yoga: a Linear regressor, a Random Forest regressor, a Ridge regressor, and an Artificial Neural Network(ANN).  I found that the ANN had the smallest mean absolute error(MAE) and mean squared error(MSE) values, which meant that the ANN’s predicted values for ADM levels were closest to the actual values compared to the other models.\n",

Traditionally, determining airfoil properties necessitates expensive experimental tests or computationally intensive simulations. This research posits that leveraging artificial intelligence could significantly reduce financial and computational costs while identifying optimal airfoil geometries. The data originates from Bigfoil, a database of airfoils compiled from UIUC’s database, Javafoil, and NACA tested airfoils. Specifically, we employed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze various airfoil images and geometric data. The image data provides the machine learning system a visual understanding of the airfoil, and allows it to pinpoint aerodynamic properties to different shapes. Our model, constructed with multiple Conv2D layers and auxiliary components, was designed to predict the lift-to-drag ratio. Preliminary results were promising: the optimal CNN configuration accurately predicted the ratios for 58.6% of previously unseen airfoils. However, there remains potential for improvement. Enhanced hyperparameter tuning could further augment the prediction accuracy. Additionally, utilizing higher-resolution images and improving image quality enhance the network's predictive capabilities.",

The model was developed using the Python scikit-learn library and was trained on 80% of the available data, while the remaining 20% was used for testing and evaluation. After preprocessing the data, the logistic regression model was trained and then predicted the occurrence of hypotension. The model demonstrated high accuracy, with 97.92% for predictions one minute ahead, but a slight decrease in accuracy was observed as the prediction time increased. When personalized for this type of surgery, the model's performance improved for only a few surgeries, otherwise not highlighting the efficacy of an individualized approach. However, the model faced limitations in predicting hypotensive events beyond a few minutes in advance, necessitating future exploration of more advanced machine learning models. While the logistic regression model's performance was promising, other machine learning models like gradient boosting and random forest algorithms also show high potential.

Symptoms include increased eye floaters, sudden flashes of light in vision, and dark shadows in the middle or on the sides of vision. It can eventually lead to blindness. Therefore, it is important that we detect it early on and treat it. This research is on how AI and machine learning can be used to detect retinal detachment using images. Before building my models, I did data pre-processing on retinal images data from four different hospitals. Then I built several different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-nearest neighbor, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, MLP Classifier, Neural Networks, and Transfer Learning. I then assessed their accuracy using certain metrics. After building the models, I calculated the accuracy score, precision score, recall score, F1 score, and built Confusion Matrices for all of the models. Our results showed a very high accuracy in all of them; they were all in the 90% to 99% range. Therefore, I can assume that Retinal Detachment can be diagnosed using Machine Learning methods. In summary, retinal detachment is a serious issue and needs to be detected and treated. Using our machine learning models, I achieved great results.\n",

The process of identifying allosteric sites through methods such as x-ray crystallography is often time-consuming, where the protein structure and the structure of potential allosteric-site binding molecules are analyzed to discover the allosteric site. Thus, machine learning models have been applied to expedite the process of allosteric drug discovery by contributing to allosteric site identification. In this study, we investigated different machine learning models and evaluated their performance, and found that the best models were the random forest classifier and a 5-layer neural network. The random forest had an accuracy of 98.89%, a precision score of 98.20%, a recall score of 99.69%, an F1 score of 98.94%, and an AUC of .9991.

Our dataset consisted of labeled image data from Professional Coin Grading Services, on which we applied affine geometric data augmentations to mitigate possible domain shift on new, “imperfect” images. We experimented with training several different convolutional neural network architectures on this data. Furthermore, we utilized several metrics to effectively evaluate and compare different coin grading models. Our final accuracy was over 50%, and 77% of the predictions were within one grade of the correct grade, affirming that a model sufficiently performant for consumer use is possible. Future work could involve crowdsourcing natural datasets of coin images and making a web or mobile application interface to make our model available to the public.",

For many consumers this could lead to overbuying, or making unwanted purchases.

This study aimed to find that correlation, using Data from the Coffee Quality Institute, taken from kaggle, and make predictions on the species based on the taste characteristics of the beans. Due to limitations with the data, and keeping in mind that the models tested weren’t tuned to perform their best, the Random Forest model performed best, having one of the highest accuracies with the most favorable set advantages and disadvantages.

      "project_desc": "This project was built with the goal of performing real-time obstacle detection on a drone. In order to achieve this given the lack of pre-existing drone image datasets, I had to collect images, label them, and train a functional model. I collected my dataset using the DJI Mavic Mini Drone and labeled the images on Roboflow, a computer vision data labeling website. I resorted to creating my own dataset focused around 6 different classes: buildings, houses, fences, poles, street signs, and trees. Based on these goals, I picked 3 locations to take pictures: Brandywine Drive, Saratoga High School, and downtown Los Gatos. I flew my drone at a varying range of altitudes from around 5-30 meters off the ground and altered the angle of the gimbal from looking straight down (90°) to horizontal views at around (10°). Throughout the process of labeling, I did not label minute objects which did not directly affect the flight path of the drone. Hence, I did not label many trees/buildings/poles/etc. in the background where I did not find it necessary to do so. Data augmentation has been key to the success I have had throughout this project. Labeling is a lengthy process requiring excessive labor, and a quick way to easily upscale the size of my dataset was through augmentation. I used Roboflow’s threefold (3x) augmentation and ended up settling on 4 types of image-level augmentation: noise, exposure, brightness, and blur. I trained my model using transfer learning on YOLOv5, and was able to achieve proficient results. Albeit mediocre training accuracies, my models performed well on test datasets, correctly creating bounding boxes with high confidences. In the near future, I will look to increase the size of my dataset and balance the label count in order to improve my model and address the skew in my dataset. Additionally, I intend to open-source my current dataset along with my best model on Kaggle and Github to help others dive into the relatively unexplored domain of drone AI.",

It's a long-lasting problem where the pressure inside your head is too high, and if left untreated, it can harm your optic nerve permanently and become tougher to handle. Making a reliable way to diagnose IIH is crucial. This helps to reduce mistakes made by people and makes treating the disorder easier.\nIIH is chronic, meaning it lasts a long time. If it's not treated, it can cause damage to the optic nerve, which is essential for vision. The longer it goes untreated, the harder it becomes to treat. This makes finding an accurate way to diagnose IIH early on very important.\nA computer model, trained on eye images, can tell if optic nerves are healthy or not with 97% accuracy. This is important because it messes up less often than people do, making it a useful tool. The model looks at pictures of the back of the eye (fundus imaging) to make these predictions.\nReducing the number of misdiagnoses is a big deal. With a higher accuracy of diagnosing IIH, we won't need experts to approve as much, and we can be better at planning how to treat it. This can lead to more efficient and effective treatment plans for individuals dealing with IIH.",

This can be very confusing for people of the older generations to understand as some sentences contain slang that does not make sense.  How can we better understand Gen-Z slang that is being used today?

The main way this problem is going to be solved is through the creation of models that can predict whether these job listings are real or fake. The procedure involves finding the dataset needed to train the model. After the preprocessing, the different NLP models were tested out to see which one would end up giving the best prediction, with the only ones that  ended up  working in the end being a Logistic Regression Model and a BERT Model. The accuracy of the Logistic Regression model ended up being 99.48%,. And after running the data through Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning, the model was left with a mean absolute error of 3.37% (low values are good!). The accuracy of the BERT model ended up being 99.81%. Overall, the accuracy of the logistic regression model on its own was excellent in separating the fake job listings from the real ones, showing its capability in that regard. The BERT model was even better, with its increase by 0.33% in terms of accuracy. Though, possible potential ways to further improve the accuracy to a greater level would be through  implementing a LSTM model, given how it can be more accurate than Logistic Regression and as accurate as a BERT model.Though, both require their own amount of preprocessing of the data that is separate from the main preprocessing already completed. Alongside that, it would be beneficial to have the models be able to take in input and be easily accessible so that anyone who is concerned about whether or not a job position is real or fake can check through imputing the information into a search box and submitting it, giving the models more data to use to improve their accuracy along with giving the public peace of mind to know that their data isn't going to get stolen.

Having a strong ML model that can distinguish between the sounds and correctly classify them, may help with a variety of social problems, such as human and animal well being, (e.g. some sounds cause harm to autistic people and/or animals), safety drills (people with hearing disabilities may not be aware of the alarms), mass shootings, etc. Although reducing a false positive rate (e.g. a rate of other sounds falsely classified as gunshots) would help decrease the number of false alarms, it is more important (for the safety and security reason) to actually reduce the false negative rate (e.g. a rate of actual gunshots not being recognized as such). \nThe research started with searching for and collecting data. The first database found in one of the public github repositories is a collection of plastic bag pop sounds. The second database is a collection of various gunshot recordings. An identical number of data points from each database was used as an input to the machine learning models. Two types of ML models have been developed: classification linear regression model and convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, in order to prevent these models from overfitting by learning from only these two different types of sound, the original dataset has been augmented and a random noise was added to the half of this enlarged database.\nThe first classification model (logistic regression) used with the original database resulted in 0.561 accuracy. When used with the augmented dataset with half of it being slightly distorted, its accuracy level was ranging from 0.557 to 0.610. The CNN model, on the other hand, produced much better results with both the original and augmented data. The accuracy level of the convolutional neural network used with the original data reached 0.972 for 14 epochs and 0.996 for 30 epochs, whereas the accuracy level of the CNN model used with the augmented data was 0.983 for 14 epochs and 0.972 for 30 of them.\nWhile CNN model reported back very high accuracy, it is still not good enough for recognizing actual gunshots among a variety of sounds, which were not used in the project, and for this reason it is not meant to be the sole tool for recognizing an active shooter.",

The motivation behind this project was to enhance aircraft safety, extend engine lifespan, and optimize maintenance schedules, thereby reducing operational costs. The initial phase involved linear regression to establish a baseline understanding, followed by the development and iterative enhancement of a neural network model. The results indicated satisfactory performance on the initial dataset, such that it performed with little loss, but revealed challenges in generalizing across different datasets, such that it performed with exceedingly more loss compared to the first dataset, pointing towards the need for more adaptive modeling and feature engineering strategies. \n",

      "project_desc": "Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are growing health challenges, as an estimated 10 million new diagnoses happen annually, highlighting the need for more efficient diagnostic processes. The lengthy process involves scheduling appointments, pre-screening assessments, and arranging screening appointments, consuming valuable time for healthcare professionals. A streamlined process leveraging computer-based screening could optimize efficiency. In fact, artificial intelligence-based systems also have potential to decrease overall healthcare costs by upwards of 10%, or over $360 billion annually (The Financial Cost of AI in Healthcare, 2023). Deep learning models, with their precision and technical capabilities, offer a promising solution. By automating screening tasks using deep learning, they can reduce administrative burdens, enhance accuracy, and expedite diagnoses, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes. The overall approach used in this research was utilizing a deep learning model, specifically a convolutional neural network. A convolutional neural network is a type of neural network architecture that specializes in identifying and making sense of patterns in image data. For this research, this type of neural network was mostly used for classifying images of dementia MRI scans based on their severities. It used certain classifying methods such as multi-class classification and a high volume of data (roughly 6400 images) to accurately distinguish between different levels of dementia severity. The model's performance metrics are robust, achieving an accuracy of 0.989, a precision of 0.99, a recall of 0.989, and an f1-score of 0.99 after 20 training epochs. These results suggest a high potential for CNN-based models to be integrated into clinical workflows, providing rapid and reliable assessments of dementia severity.",

The approach involved the use of different AI algorithms which were trained on a dataset of thousands of individual images, and identifying which models yielded the best results. Just from graphing the data, it was shown that the malignant images were darker on average, with lower average color values for each pixel. The test accuracy of most models ranged between 80 - 90%, proving that the AI models were able to correctly predict malignant v/s non-malignant 80 - 90% of the time. Through my research, I discovered that AI models have the ability to correctly predict melanoma by processing images using a variety of algorithms through which the data is trained.

      "project_desc": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) poses a significant threat to global health, responsible for approximately one-third of all deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in preventing severe complications, yet traditional methods often require expensive tests and equipment. Machine learning offers an innovative and more cost-efficient alternative, through pattern recognition of more lightweight data to accurately predict CVD presence and severity. In this paper, we look past traditional binary approaches to CVD diagnosis and look towards quantitative ordinal labels, where a higher number represents more severity. Using the UC Irvine Heart Disease dataset, we test six lightweight models — Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVC), and Decision Trees (DT) — alongside a custom neural network model to evaluate their performance on this multi-class classification task. Each model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are analyzed to assess robustness in clinical settings. The RF, KNN, and custom models achieved testing accuracies above 86%, with the KNN leading in accuracy, precision, and recall, going beyond the baseline LR model’s accuracy of 52%. Our findings demonstrate that lightweight models are highly effective for CVD prediction, offering potential for future deployment in AI-assisted tasks in hospitals. However, these models lack explainability behind diagnosis, which is essential for real-world deployment. Future directions include exploring wearable technology for continuous CVD monitoring and the inclusion of worldwide data to account for diverse risk factors.",

      "project_desc": "As the number of users on social media platforms continues to rise, an increasing number of people are expressing their emotions and opinions. Before the popularity of multimodal machine learning, previous works included identifying texts and images separately to determine sentiment. However, these studies often overlooked features that other modalities could capture that are crucial to emotion. Recent advances in multimodal machine learning are now making essential and precise judgments in image recognition [1]. In this project, we explore a specific type of fusion called late fusion, demonstrating its ability to combine different modalities. In particular, we highlight two late fusion methods that combine the predictions of the image and text models. Additionally, we investigate a contrastive learning approach, which will help improve the visual embeddings, making them more discriminative in feature space. We compare the strengths and limitations of late fusion against other fusion approaches. Our findings are based on experiments conducted with the publicly available MVSA-Single dataset.\n",

This work aims to examine the extent of how predictions of students’ success in school can be improved by using AI models and neural networks with respect to student performance, and consequently study more effective resource allocation among students. We concentrate on exploiting artificial neural networks to predict student results; using information about academic history, socio-economic status, attendance rates and engagement levels etc., which inform the allocation of resources like educational materials, teachers, technology devices, & mentors accordingly. We tested different models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Decision Decision Trees, and neural networks with dense layers. The study finds that using advanced predictive models can greatly increase the types of educational support we offer, reduce disparities in student performance, and address issues revolving around how and where resource allocations may be most equitable. Therefore, we propose a strand of research to mitigate educational resource imbalances and better support low-attainment students with targeted interventions informed by predictive analytics.",

The aim is to bridge the gap between traditional literature and modern digital media by enhancing readers’ visualization of narratives through AI-generated imagery. This is particularly important in the digital age, where engagement with text is evolving due to shorter attention spans and the rise of multimedia content. The methodology involved data preprocessing, including text normalization, tokenization, and sentiment analysis, followed by genre classification using natural language processing(NLP) techniques and a Random Forest classifier. Advanced NLP and image generation models, GPT-3.5-Trubo and DALL-E were then used to create detailed and consistent visual representations of the text. The result demonstrated the models’ ability to generate images that aligned with the narrative and tone of the text, though challenges with consistency and handling complex narrative elements were identified. The study concludes that with further refinement, AI has the potential to transform the reading experience by offering new opportunities for engagement , accessibility, and innovation in the literary space. Future research will focus on experimenting with more advanced models, expanding the dataset, and exploring techniques for maintaining visual consistency across generated images.",

Currently, there is no specific clinical test that can test for Parkinsons, therefore many cases go undiagnosed. Patients that do get diagnosed  often must go through a lengthy and expensive process of a series of examinations and consultations with specialists. In this paper, we present a few machine learning models, including logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Transfer Learning, as a potential way to detect Parkinson’s through patients’ drawings of spirals and waves. We decided to use patients’ drawings, as this data is much more accessible and inexpensive to obtain in comparison to imaging or lab results. Coupling this data with machine learning models could therefore serve to increase Parkinson’s diagnoses, particularly in developing countries, and ultimately help patients receive better treatment options. Our results show that the logistic regression classifier performed the best, with  an accuracy of 91%, precision score of 92%, and recall score of 89%. These results show that machine learning and spiral and wave drawings can be used as a viable tool for furthering Parkinson’s diagnosis.",

State-sponsored actors have become highly sophisticated, with capabilities that leverage the power of technology to prey on governments and companies. Yet despite this sophistication, their attack patterns often have similar digital fingerprints. This reality creates the possibility that past attacks may provide clues for future ones.

However, we have yet to see researchers try to simplify their model in order to maintain high model performance while minimizing the number of features used. Because of this, we used dimensionality reduction methods like Pearson Correlation and Principal Component Analysis on sklearn classification models like Random Forests and Support Vector Classifiers to try and solve this issue. It was found that with a Pearson Correlation Coefficient cut-off of 0.01, model accuracy was increased from 87.51% to 87.83% while reducing the number of features used by two, meaning our goal was accomplished. In addition, a stacking ensemble yielded an accuracy of 88.04% with fast predicting speed.",

With over 5.4 million individuals in the United States diagnosed with ASD, early detection is critical for improving outcomes through timely intervention. Eye-tracking technology, which monitors visual attention patterns, has emerged as a potential tool for early diagnosis. Our research aimed to explore whether eye-tracking scan path images could be used to predict the presence of ASD by applying machine learning techniques. We collected eye-tracking data from individuals with ASD and non-ASD controls, processed the images to enhance clarity, and labeled them accordingly (ASD = 1, non-ASD = 0). Several machine learning models were tested, with logistic regression being the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 74.6% using a regularization parameter (C) of 0.1. This indicates that while eye-tracking can aid in ASD classification, there is still room for improvement in model performance. Our findings suggest that eye-tracking combined with machine learning has the potential to assist in early ASD detection. This non-invasive method may also be useful in diagnosing other neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer’s, offering healthcare professionals a new approach for early intervention.\n",

Superheavy elements usually have very short half-lives, but a few isotopes are predicted to have long enough half-lives for potential applications in nuclear and material science. To calculate these half-lives, we initially used a deep learning regression model with Keras library’s dense layers that took proton count and neutron count as inputs and $\\log_{10}$ of the half-life as the output. When it was tested on various isotopes of the periodic table, there was an MSE (mean squared error) of 111. Afterwards, more input variables related to proton and neutron count were added to increase complexity, leading to an MSE of 97. This suggests that the model on average falls many orders of magnitude off from the actual half-life, which would make accurate prediction of half-lives difficult. It is possible that more complexity, through different kinds of layers, and different inputs may be needed to accurately predict the half-lives of nuclides (another word for isotopes). ",

Given the increasing burden of dementia for individuals, families and healthcare systems, there is an urgent need for innovative research to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Understanding the risk factors and underlying mechanisms of dementia is critical for developing effective strategies to combat this debilitating disease. Early detection is crucial for managing symptoms and potentially slowing progression. By understanding how medical factors influence dementia risk, doctors may be able to identify individuals who could benefit from early intervention and lifestyle changes to help prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Previous research has explored how factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and even personality traits can be linked to an increased risk of dementia [3]. However, these studies often rely on self-reported data or focus on a single factor, making it difficult to untangle the complex causes of dementia. The research took a more comprehensive approach by using a dementia patient characteristics dataset with several medical factors. The approach built machine learning models to predict the relationship between patient health parameters such as heart rate, presence of diabetes, and weight and the likelihood of dementia. Logistic regression and random forest algorithms were applied, and the random forest model correctly predicted dementia presence with 52% accuracy, whereas the logistic regression model predicted dementia with 48% accuracy. Future work will tune the models to improve the results and determine which factors were most influential in predicting dementia.",

      "project_desc": "Arthritis, particularly of the knee, is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide and seriously hinders patients' mobility and quality of life. Early diagnosis is essential for effective intervention; however, diagnosis using X-ray imaging is difficult due to the subtlety and variability manifested in the various states of the disease. Deep learning methods, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are proposed for the automatic grading of knee arthritis into five classes: Normal, Doubtful, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. This is an artificial intelligence system that avoids the many difficulties of manual diagnosis, which are inconsistent between radiologists and very time-consuming with current methods, to increase the diagnostic accuracy and consistency, especially in developing or resource-constrained settings with limited specialist access.\n\nThe study uses transfer learning with state-of-the-art models, such as EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3, to improve the classification of arthritis severity on X-ray images. Pre-trained layers on ImageNet datasets were fine-tuned for the knee arthritis dataset by adding custom classification heads to each model. Data preprocessing methods, including resizing and normalization, were also applied to ensure uniformity throughout the dataset. Their performances were tested with the use of such metrics as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, validated against different stages in the development of arthritis. Of special note was EfficientNetB0, showing better results of up to an 85% accuracy score for this overall scenario.\n\nWhile the models showed promising results, they still struggled with the accurate classification of cases of Mild arthritis, indicating a need for further refinement. This study has brought out the potential of AI-based diagnostic tools in reducing diagnostic variability, speeding up the determination of arthritis severity, and improving patient outcomes. However, it also responds to key concerns about the \"black box\" nature of deep learning models, which can impede clinical adoption. To tackle this challenge, the research highlights the importance of explainable AI methodologies in building trust in practitioners of healthcare through the interpretability of predictive models.\n\nThis study has significant implications for the medical field, as it demonstrates the potential of AI in helping radiologists and primary care providers achieve better accuracy and consistency in diagnosing knee arthritis. Their deployment in mobile or cloud-based settings may greatly increase the access to diagnostic tools in remote or disadvantaged areas. Future efforts in research will go in the direction of increasing diversity in datasets, adding multimodal data, and interpretability of models to encourage widespread adoption in clinical practice. To make effective and scalable artificial intelligence solutions available for more precise, rapid, and fairer diagnoses of knee arthritis, with an overall goal to have better patient management and care in mind.",

Specifically, based on certain locations in a scene, I examined algorithms that will allow a drone to autonomously find the smoothest path to reach each location while maintaining smooth camera quality. Drones play a significant role in modern cinematography, particularly in creating dynamic aerial shots and panoramic photographs. Given their importance, drones must operate smoothly and reliably. Implementing autonomous path planning will reduce common challenges, such as collision risks, while also limiting manual navigation, minimizing the need for human intervention while enabling safer, more efficient, and faster filming with high-definition (HD) video quality. I used a simulation system, Gazebo, and the ROS (Robot Operating System) interface as an open-source platform for coding, and together they simulated autonomous drone movements. By creating and using multiple path planning algorithms—A-star (A*), Dijkstra’s, and Greedy Best First Search (GBFS)—I enabled the drone to autonomously move to a certain position while accounting for obstacles in a static environment. The drones were able to efficiently detect obstacles and calculate optimal routes, with A* demonstrating the highest average efficiency. In comparison to Dijkstra’s algorithm, A* often reduced pathfinding time by around 70%. Additionally, its paths were generally more accurate than the GBFS algorithm in various situations, reducing travel time by around 30% on average when larger obstacles and environments were tested. The results of this study present A* as the optimal path planning algorithm that can be implemented to improve autonomous drone cinematography in future applications. Furthermore, another form of path planning, which uses roadmaps to autonomously move a drone, is also explored to help prevent concerns with restricted areas and cluttered environments, and to allow personalized cinematography on human-made paths.",

It consists of many nuances and patterns that are organized into various ragams, which are melodic frameworks for a song that dictate the types of notes and modulations present.

To address this challenge, I built a model using a Random Forest Classifier that analyzes features such as Chroma Short-Time Fourier Transform, Spectral Centroid, Spectral Bandwidth, various MFCC coefficients, and the ragam label in order to identify the ragam of the audio clip. The model was trained on a dataset of 1112 audio clips that includes 32 ragams– 7 melakarta “parent” ragams and 25 janya “child” ragams (Sanjana Satish68l). Each ragam has certain patterns within its features that make it easy to distinguish from other ragams, and therefore easy for the model to categorize. By analyzing these distinct features, the model was able to accurately classify the ragam of almost all the test clips. The accuracy was considerably high: around 99.1%, which outperformed both the K Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree models. ",

      "project_title": "Predicting Investment Success on Shark Tank India: A Machine Learning Approach ",
      "project_desc": "Shark Tank is a critical platform for emerging entrepreneurs, offering not only financial investment but also valuable visibility from renowned investors, or \"Sharks.\" While extensive research has been conducted on Shark Tank in Western markets, there is a notable gap in studies focusing on the Indian context. India has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with a rapidly expanding startup ecosystem that is significantly different from Western markets. Additionally, Indian entrepreneurs face unique challenges, such as limited access to funding, regional disparities, and a complex regulatory environment, which make the Shark Tank platform particularly impactful for their success. Understanding the specific factors that influence investment decisions in this context—such as investor preferences, market fit, and demographic considerations—can provide invaluable insights for entrepreneurs looking to secure funding. This study addresses the challenge of predicting whether a pitch will receive an offer by leveraging a diverse dataset with input factors from both U.S. and Indian datasets. It employs a range of regression models, a neural network, and transfer learning techniques to adapt insights from U.S. data to the Indian context, improving the model's predictive accuracy across different markets.    Results indicate that the neural network model achieved the highest predictive accuracy, capturing complex interactions better than simpler models. Remarkably, transfer learning provided reasonable results even after removing city and state features, underscoring its adaptability across diverse markets. These findings highlight the potential of advanced machine learning techniques to improve understanding of investment dynamics in emerging economies like India.",

      "project_title": "Diabetic Retinopathy Evaluation: A ViT Approach",
      "project_desc": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes, which afflicts about 400 million people in today's world, that causes the blood vessels of the retina to swell and to leak fluids and blood. Early detection of DR can help manage it with lifestyle changes and medical interventions, preventing the need for costly treatments like laser or surgery, and providing a much better standard of life. This motivates the search for easier, affordable and accessible DR detection technology using the help of Artificial Intelligence given the huge number of potential patients.\n\nThis paper investigates the application of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for classifying diabetic retinopathy severity levels from fundus images, aiming to provide accurate predictions essential for early diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTo optimize model performance, images were preprocessed to appropriate resolutions, and the dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets. Data augmentation techniques, including geometric transformations and color adjustments, were employed to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting. The ViT model was modified by freezing upper layers and adjusting the final fully connected layer to classify images across five severity levels, leveraging transfer learning for efficient fine-tuning.\n\nWith a learning rate of 0.0002 and a batch size of 52, the model was trained with early stopping, achieving a validation accuracy of 75.96%, a loss of 0.58, a recall of 0.72, a precision of 0.700, and an F1-score of 0.675.These results demonstrate the model’s balanced performance, capturing most positive cases while maintaining reasonable precision. Yet, the results fell short of 90%+ accuracy obtained in [8] throughout our testing period and more analysis is necessary to assess. Future work will explore dynamic learning rate schedules and alternative batch sizes to further enhance model accuracy to reach the higher goal.\n\nThis study highlights the Vision Transformer model’s potential for nuanced medical image classification tasks, contributing to advancements in automated diagnostic tools.",

People use AI to create art, but not in the ethical way that it should be used, that is, the art generated by the AI is taken and claimed as their original work. This is often the result of a lack of creativity, but it can also cause creativity to reduce as well. So, instead of using AI in a way that hinders the creative process, I wanted to use it in a way that promotes the process. My app Art Intel combines my passion for art and my interest in artificial intelligence by utilizing generative AI to serve as an ally in the creative process to solve that problem. Rather than the AI giving back an image with the fixes made, making it easy for the artist to steal it and claim it as their own, Art Intel will be by your side to guide you down the path from good art to great art, without taking away creative liberties.",
